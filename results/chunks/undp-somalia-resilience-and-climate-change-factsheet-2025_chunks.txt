© UNDP Years of conflict, under-investment and natural disasters caused by climate change are taking lives, destroying livelihoods and threatening biodiversity. Somalia faced its most devastating drought on record from 2021 to 2023, marked by five consecutive failed rainy seasons. This crisis displaced hundreds of thousands, jeopardized livelihoods, and raised the specter of famine in certain areas. In 2022, the drought impacted 7.8 million people, nearly half of the country’s population. Drought-induced displacement in Somalia surpassed 1.3 million people, a five-fold increase since early 2022, with nearly 40 percent of the population requiring urgent food assistance. Hunger and disease have already claimed many lives. In 2023, El-Nino flash floods affected at least 247,000 people in 384 informal settlements. Only 52 percent of Somalia’s population has access to a basic water supply, leading to families fetching water from distant and unsafe open wells due to expensive prices imposed by unregulated private water suppliers. CLIMATE RESILIENCE in Somalia Building UNDP works with the government of Somalia to help communities and institutions protect the environment, generate clean energy and prepare to meet the challenges of climate change. All our work is carried out in line with the government’s National Development Plan and in close coordination with UN partner agencies. Our current efforts to build Somalia’s climate resilience are using the following approaches: Supporting national and sub- national institutions in formulating climate-resilient policies and implementing legislative reforms Promoting alternative energy sources to reduce local charcoal consumption Strengthening institutional coordination and building capacities for better adaptation planning Providing integrated support in sustainable water resource management, environmental governance, and disaster risk reduction Helping increase energy access and promoting investment in renewable energy mini-grids OUR RESPONSE • People affected by drought: 7.8 million • People displaced by drought: 1.3 million • Population needing urgent food assistance: 40% • People affected by El-Nino flash floods: 247,000 • Population with access to basic water supply: 52% • Annual deforestation rate: 40,000 hectares • Trees felled annually: 5 million • People affected by last Dyre floods: 2.5 million © IPSOS Somalia: Key Facts Policy Development • Supported key policies, including National Climate Change Policy, National Environmental Strategy, Charcoal Policy and National Water Resources Strategy. • Enabled completion of the NDC report for climate action and resilience. • Assisted in validating the National Hydro-met Policy, compliant with World Meteorological Organization standards. Alternative Energy • Transitioned 10,151 households, mainly women-led (95 percent), to eco-friendly energy sources, reducing deforestation and charcoal consumption. • Sensitized over 2 million people on sustainable resource management and facilitated 5,000 households’ shift to alternative livelihoods. • Integrated solar energy in five hospitals, reducing energy costs and improving operational capacity. Capacity Development • Engaged with 17 government institutions and 3,241 individuals for environmental management and disaster risk reduction. • Upgraded implementation of multilateral environmental agreements at all levels. • Supported environment ministries in establishing websites and social media platforms. • Strengthened water management coordination through IWRM initiatives. • Enhanced National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) for monitoring drought and famine, and established early warning systems in Somaliland and Puntland. • Developed a scholarship programme for master’s degrees in environmental studies at Amoud University. • Launched Somalia’s first MSc in Integrated Water Resources Management at Somali National University, with 29 students (30 percent women) completing courses in its first year. Disaster Risk Reduction • Prepared Municipal disaster risk reduction (DRR) plans for four cities and local DRR funding frameworks in nine districts. • Supported drafting Somalia’s National DRR plan. • Backed Recovery and Resilience Framework for long-term disaster solutions. Access to Water and Nature-Based Solutions • Improved water access for 21,340 women- headed households through medium-scale water infrastructures. • Constructed reservoirs and dams for drought resilience. • Employed climate-smart water harvesting infrastructures benefiting 4,600 households. • Implemented nature-based solutions benefiting 62,696 households, 52 percent women-headed. • Rehabilitated 6,285 hectares of rangelands. 3 © UNDP KEY ACHIEVEMENTS Project Name Focus Areas Project Duration Partners Donors Total Budget Africa Mini-grids Programme – Somalia Child Programme SDG 7 2022–2026 Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources -SL, Ministry of Energy and Water Resources- FGS GEF, UNDP US$4,026,147 Integrated Water Resources Management – IWRM SDGs 2, 6, 13 2020–2024 MoEWR - FGS, MOECC -FGS, MOECC - Somaliland, MOECC-Puntland, Puntland Water Agency (PWA), Ministry of Water Resources - Somaliland GEF,UNDP US$10,331,000 Resilience through Water, Environment and Disaster Management – WED SDG 13 2020–2024 MoEWR - FGS, MOECC -FGS, MOECC - FMS, MOHADM -FGS, FMS, Somali Disaster Management Agency (SODMA), Banadir Regional Administration, Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR).
