Social and Economic Environment Global AI Trends Global developments in AI and emerging technologies are shaping the future of various industries and societies worldwide. The World Economic Forum notes that the world's five leading economies, the US, China, Japan, India, and Germany, have vested interests in the global AI ecosystem, with the US and China leading, characterised by the highest percentages in venture capital investment in AI across different sectors. This has led to a new emergent technology sub-sector, with projections by PwC suggesting AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Majority of these gains are expected from enhanced productivity and increased consumer demand for AI-driven product innovations. Other global trends on AI defining the social and economic environment include: ● Increased Infrastructure Investment: In 2023, investments into the GPU market crossed into the $1T cap club due to high demand from nation-states, startups, big tech and researchers alike. Microsoft carved out an annual spend of $50 billion for AI infrastructure in 2023 and beyond, a yearly investment amount unmatched by any other company worldwide. ● Increased Innovation Spending: Generative AI apps have had a breakout year across image, video, coding, voice or co-pilots for everyone, driving $18B of VC and corporate investments. ● Labor Market Transformation: The integration of AI into the workforce is expected to cause significant disruptions. According to the IMF, around 40% of global jobs are exposed to AI, with advanced economies facing a higher risk due to the potential automation of high-skilled roles. This raises concerns about job displacement and the need for large-scale reskilling programs. ● Global Inequalities: AI's rapid advancement is likely to exacerbate existing inequalities, both within and across nations. In advanced economies, AI may benefit - 15 - high-income workers disproportionately, while those in lower-income or less skilled roles may face greater job insecurity. Emerging markets, with less developed digital infrastructure and workforce capabilities, could struggle to leverage AI's benefits, potentially widening the global inequality gap. ● Ethical Concerns on AI: As AI becomes more integrated into various aspects of life, public sentiment towards the technology is increasingly cautious. AI-driven misinformation and disinformation campaigns created by ‘deepfakes’, concerns about privacy and online safety on social media platforms, are eroding public trust in established institutions and processes such as elections. According to the Global Index on Responsible AI, only 38 countries assessed have taken steps to address the safety, accuracy and reliability of AI systems. Regional Context Recent global shocks including the COVID 19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions such as the war between Russia and Ukraine have severely impacted Africa’s economic growth with real GDP growth dropping from 4.1% in 2022 to 3.1% in 2023. African economies are projected to rebound, with 9 of the top 20 fastest growing economies from the continent. However, there still remain challenges to achieving Africa’s development goals and economic and social agendas as laid down in Agenda 2063 and the Maputo protocol. These include political unrest, climate shocks and high external debts. According to the World Bank, in 2023, a third of the continent’s population was still living in extreme poverty with energy and transportation bottlenecks limiting productivity and efficient harnessing of natural resources. The African population is youthful with 12 million youth expected to enter the labour force each year for the foreseeable future with a risk of high unemployment levels. The AfDB in its 2024 economic outlook identifies that Africa needs to close an annual financing gap of over US $402 billion and invest in key areas such as education, energy and productivity-enhancing technology and innovation to fasttrack the achievement of its development goals. AI is one of these technologies and it is projected to generate $1.2 trillion economic value in Africa by 2030 contributing a 5.6% increase to the continent’s GDP by 2030 through financial inclusion, employment creation, increased agricultural productivity and enhanced public service delivery. There are a number of regional initiatives embracing the AI opportunity. A mapping exercise conducted by the Center for Intellectual Property and Information Technology (CIPIT) on AI applications in Africa identified 301 AI solutions in 27 countries and 41 sectors. These AI application types include data analytics, chatbots, decision support tools, and diagnostic tools in sectors including corporate services, health, education, agriculture, and finance. Some of the major initiatives contributing to a growing AI ecosystem on the continent include: - Masakhane - a grassroots organisation of researchers and innovators working collectively on NLP research in African Languages. - Lacuna Fund - a collaborative initiative funding and providing resources for data scientists, researchers, and social entrepreneurs to create and share labelled training datasets for AI. - 16 - - AI4D - an initiative by a network of funders that partners with Africa’s science and policy communities to leverage AI through high-quality research, responsible innovation, and talent strengthening. - FairForward - An initiative by GIZ supporting knowledge transfer on AI, improved access to training data and AI technology and the development of policy frameworks for ethical AI National Context There are a number of start-ups and solutions signifying an emerging AI-driven economy and sector in Kenya. Research shows that AI utilisation in Kenya is more pronounced in the key sectors of health, education, agriculture, and finance. AI applications are utilised across sectors through varied application types, i.e., Chabots, decision support, and data analytics tools. In finance, AI-powered solutions have facilitated financial services to previously underserved populations, promoting financial inclusion and access to credit. AI tools have enhanced crop monitoring, yield prediction, and agricultural pest management, leading to increased productivity and sustainable farming practices. These AI-driven initiatives have improved operational efficiency and contributed to Kenya's overall economic growth and competitiveness in the global market. AI development by startups and large technology companies fosters innovation and job creation for Kenya’s population, further underscoring AI's transformative potential in driving economic efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainable growth in Kenya's evolving digital economy. 3.2. Technology Environment Global Context The Global AI Readiness Index 2024 notes that the United States leads China, the EU, and the UK as the leading source of top AI models. Notably, in 2023, 61 AI models originated from US-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15. At a firm level, there were notable advancements in AI research, both proprietary and open source; advancements in model development especially in LLMs and diffusion models, with multimodality becoming a new frontier; we witnessed renewed concerns about data, especially human generated data and synthetic data; and also increased collaborations between governments, academia and the private sector. African Context A few key AI initiatives are transforming Africa’s technological landscape. There are notable efforts focused on strengthening African AI and machine learning communities. Many continental forums, workshops and conferences, provide opportunities for learning, networking, and collaboration among African AI practitioners. - 17 - Several big tech companies have set up research labs across the continent with several labs domiciled in Kenya. The research labs focus on key sectors of development such as health, transportation, the environment, etc. National Context Digital Infrastructure and Technology Landscape Kenya has made major strides in deploying digital infrastructure, and in particular fiber and mobile network infrastructure. As of early 2024, Kenya had more than 65 million mobile connections. The government of Kenya over the last 15 years prioritised the development of the digital landscape through investments in terrestrial fibre networks and in the digitization of government services, such as through the eCitizen portal, which provides online access to various public services, enhancing efficiency and accessibility for citizens. Kenya's data centre infrastructure is also rapidly evolving to meet the demands of a growing digital economy. The country hosts several state-of-the-art data centres that provide reliable and secure data storage and processing capabilities. The availability of data, internet coverage and a population that significantly conducts commerce and other services digitally has created a supportive environment for different startups and organisations who either develop or deploy solutions that leverage artificial intelligence technologies. AI technology ecosystem Technology and developer communities have played a crucial role in the areas of software development and particularly in machine learning and data science, which are key areas that contribute to AI development. The developer communities use different online or physical forums to hold educational workshops, share experiences and learn about the various technologies. Different tech communities have been set up locally in Kenya, and most are still active. Some are listed here, https://devs.info.ke/ Kenyan leading universities and tertiary institutions of higher learning offer courses in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, local organisations have been at the forefront of partnering with government agencies to work on projects aimed at improving data quality towards application of LLM’s. Research and Development Kenya is emerging as a hub for AI research and development in Africa, with a growing number of initiatives focused on leveraging AI to address local and regional challenges. AI research activities span developing AI models for predictive analytics, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. These activities are often supported by collaborations between academic institutions, private sector companies, and international organisations, fostering a vibrant research ecosystem. Academic institutions have set up labs and research centres which conduct research in various areas of AI and machine learning. - 18 - Other non-academic research institutions have also been active in the AI research space, receiving interest funding from development partners to tackle areas where AI can be useful for development such as health, agriculture, commerce, etc. A review of existing tech communities in Kenya paints a clear picture of the available skills, interests, and initiatives undertaken by practitioners operating in Kenya to grow and advance knowledge in different tech sectors, with AI being one of them. The presence of tech communities has further showcased the high level of tech skills available in the country, which has resulted in global big tech companies setting up different research and product-building centres based in Kenya. Many of these big tech establishments in Kenya have been a first within Sub-Saharan Africa. 3.3. Political Environment Global Context The world has divided into clear regulatory camps, but progress on a consensus on global governance remains slower. Some tensions arising within the AI sector include from the chip wars with the US mobilising its allies, and the Chinese response remaining patchy. Export controls rate limit advanced chip sales to China, but major chip vendors create export control- proof alternatives. Countries such as the UK government have taken an approach towards improving public service delivery by establishing an AI incubator. Finding a balance between fostering innovation and regulating risks associated with AI technologies remains a key challenge for jurisdictions worldwide. Countries are exploring ways to promote innovation while safeguarding fundamental rights, privacy, and security in AI. International summits, declarations, and agreements, such as the G7 Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles and the Bletchley Declaration, demonstrate global collaboration in addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by AI technologies. These initiatives aim to foster cooperation and coordination in AI governance efforts. Developed economies actively craft comprehensive AI governance policies to balance innovation with risk regulation. This is seen through governance practices of the EU, UK, and US, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for ethical AI usage characterised by the different approaches to AI governance, human-centric approaches, risk-based approaches, or the safety-based approach. Regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States of America have taken enforcement actions against tech companies like Amazon concerning privacy violations related to AI technologies. The cases brought against Amazon's Alexa App and Ring cameras require the deletion of certain data and prohibit the use of specific information for model training. Countries, organisations, international and regional bodies are increasingly focusing on developing ethical AI frameworks to ensure the responsible and transparent use of AI technologies. Initiatives such as the OECD AI Principles, UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, the AU Continental AI Strategy, and the EU AI Act aim to establish ethical AI development and deployment guidelines. Efforts are underway to harmonise AI regulations across borders to facilitate international cooperation and ensure consistency in AI governance. Multilateral organisations like the - 19 - OECD, UNESCO, and the EU are working on frameworks to address global challenges posed by AI technologies. Regional Context A number of African countries have formulated national AI strategies to drive innovation, economic growth, and societal development. These strategies outline priorities for AI research, development, readiness measurement and deployment while emphasising ethical considerations and human-centric approaches to AI governance. Further, national AI strategies have become the foundational starting point for AI governance in the African continent, where there is a notable increase in the development of national AI strategies, which is likely to grow in the coming years, noting the ongoing initiatives to guide AI development highlighting a commitment to integrating AI into National development plans. Developed and developing countries emphasise the importance of ethical AI practices, especially for African nations, mirroring trends in developed countries where ethical considerations are centred in AI policy discussions. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards regional cooperation in AI governance. Adopting the AU Continental Strategy on AI regionally points towards a continental focus on AI governance. In both developed economies and African nations, the private sector increasingly adopts AI solutions across various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and agriculture. The private sector continues to play a significant role in driving AI innovation and efficiency, which is seen to be essential to overall economic growth. Key opportunities will derive from integrating AI into national development plans, presenting opportunities for economic growth, innovation and improved public service delivery, further contextualising areas of focus in AI governance. Regulatory harmonisation presents a challenge for African countries, noting the varied approaches, i.e. risk-based, human-centric, and safety-based approaches, bringing in the importance of international cooperation in creating cohesive development practices and frameworks. The EAC member countries have also established foundational frameworks where data sharing and data protection is concerned, such as in trade, health, data protection, education standards and financial services. These foundations become near-future enablers for harmonised AI regulations. National Context Kenya has shown political will for advancing AI adoption by prioritising emerging technologies and AI in the National Digital Economy Blueprint, where AI is referenced as a tool for driving innovation-driven entrepreneurship and the Kenya National Digital Master Plan (2022-2032), which notes the importance of a national strategy on AI and key focus areas that need to be addressed by the National AI strategic plan. Kenya also made commitments to building an AI-powered Smart City, the Konza Technopolis currently houses the country's data centre. Additionally, the Technopolis authorities signed an MoU with a cyberschool to facilitate training of Kenyan youth on AI and cyber security while the African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS) is planning to establish an AI centre of excellence at the Technopolis. - 20 - Other agencies, such as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, have embraced AI in their operations such as their AI-powered Chabot, Linda Data which provides citizens with a platform to interact with the chatbot to address data protection queries, raising awareness which can ultimately be used to scale the citizen information repository whose effective use can inform the ethical AI framework for the country. The National Statistical Organization, the Kenya National Bureau of Standards, is committed to expanding the mandate of data and evidence generation through its recently launched data centre. 3.4. Legal and Regulatory Environment Global Context The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has prompted the development of global policy and legal regulatory frameworks to ensure their ethical and responsible use. These frameworks vary by region and organisations but share common goals, including promoting innovation, protecting human rights, governing administration, and mitigating risks associated with AI. The Global AI Law and Policy Tracker offers an extensive overview of AI governance frameworks across various countries and jurisdictions. The AI Equality Initiative (AIEI) has established a community of practice towards empowered ethical AI, which considers a just, responsible, and inclusive AI global ecosystem. The AIEI proposes a global AI observatory (GAIO) model to inform policy development. Though slow, in comparison between 2022 and 2023 saw a substantial rise in the number of countries with laws that include the term "AI," growing from 25 countries in 2022 to 127 in 2023, an indication of the growing recognition of the need for regulatory frameworks and AI governance. Additionally, diverse legislative approaches are being pursued. The European Union (EU) for instance, has been at the forefront of building a robust AI regulatory framework, the EU AI Act. This Act was expected to come into force on 1st August 2024 across all the 27 EU member states. The EU AI Act distinctively takes a risk-based approach towards regulating AI. This approach imposes regulatory burdens only when an AI system is likely to pose high risks to fundamental rights and safety. The Act establishes a four-tiered risk framework, which classifies risk into four categories: unacceptable risks that lead to prohibited practices, high risks that trigger a set of stringent obligations, some of which include conducting a conformity assessment, limited risks which relate to transparency obligations, and minimal risks where codes of conduct by stakeholder are encouraged regardless of whether established within EU or third country. The US, on the other hand, has so far issued an executive order on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI, as well as the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which sets out five principles and associated practices to guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the rights of the American public. The UK takes a more safety- based approach towards the governance of AI, fortified during the UK AI Safety Summit 2023, which advanced the establishment of AI safety Institutes, global commitments by tech- companies united to establish science and empirically led guidelines, standards, and collaborations. The Bletchley Declaration, a product of the summit, advocates for advancing the need to identify AI risks and inform risk-based policy development. - 21 - In Colombia, initiatives like the AI Expert Mission and AI National Strategy Policy have been implemented. The United States has released multiple frameworks and guidelines to maintain its leadership in AI research and control government use of AI. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued guidelines to prevent biassed or unfair AI use, while Singapore’s PDPC offers advisory guidelines to support AI implementation while maintaining data protection. In December 2023, the EU AI Act was finalised, introducing harmonised rules for AI in the EU market with a risk-based approach, prohibiting specific AI systems, and imposing requirements and transparency rules on high-risk systems. Australia's 2021 AI Action Plan aims to build AI capability and promote trusted, secure AI technologies. Privacy enforcement authorities (PEAs) across various jurisdictions have taken significant actions in response to privacy concerns surrounding AI technologies, particularly generative AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT. In Canada, the Federal Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) and provincial privacy authorities launched an investigation into ChatGPT for processing personal data without consent. This investigation was expanded to include assessments of OpenAI's compliance with transparency, access, accuracy, and accountability principles. Similarly, Italy's PEA (Garante) temporarily blocked OpenAI from processing personal data due to potential GDPR violations, which included issues related to transparency and data protection by design. Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission (PPC) warned OpenAI about collecting sensitive data without consent, emphasising the need for clear notices in Japanese about data collection purposes. In Korea, the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) fined OpenAI for not notifying a data breach and identified multiple non-compliance issues with the country's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), including the lack of clarity in the controller- processor relationship and absence of parental consent for children under 14. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has also been active, fining Clearview AI for unauthorised use of facial images and issuing enforcement notices to Snap Inc. regarding the privacy risks posed by its generative AI chatbot 'My AI'. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken multiple enforcement actions involving AI, including cases against Rite Aid for biased facial recognition technology and Amazon for violations related to its Alexa App and Ring cameras. Internationally, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) formed a task force to enhance cooperation and information exchange in handling complaints and investigations into OpenAI and ChatGPT at the EU level. The Ibero-American Network of Data Protection (RIPD) initiated a coordinated action on ChatGPT compliance among its member countries. These actions underscore the commonalities in legal obligations regarding the processing of personal data by generative AI and highlight the importance of international cooperation in enforcing privacy laws. The OECD is also revising its Recommendation on Cross-Border Cooperation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy to strengthen these collaborative efforts. Privacy Enforcement Authorities (PEAs) collaborate globally, evidenced by statements and resolutions on generative AI from G7 countries and the Global Privacy Assembly. Various PEAs have issued guidance on applying privacy laws to AI, with notable initiatives in Canada, France, Spain, Türkiye, the UK, the US, and Singapore. These include principles for responsible AI development, action plans, compliance guidance, and frameworks to ensure AI technologies align with privacy regulations. For instance, France’s CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'informatique et des Libertés - National Commission of Informatics and Liberty) has - 22 - developed an action plan for AI that respects privacy, and the UK's ICO has provided comprehensive AI and data protection guidance. Regional Context A general observance of AI governance in Africa shows increased AI policy initiatives, primarily national AI strategies. The governance of AI in Africa takes a varied approach. A recent report published by UNESCO from a survey conducted of 32 African countries shows that 18 out of 32 countries have ongoing initiatives to guide the development of AI at the national level. The development and use of AI are a priority according to the national development plans of 21 out of 32 countries. Out of the 32 respondents, 13 countries have launched AI strategies, 13 have developed AI policies, six have reported enacting legislation to address some of the challenges of AI, 12 have established Centers of Excellence on AI, and 3 have reported issuing ethical guidelines for AI. (Countries that participated in the survey include Angola, Benin, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe). More substantively, the African Union (AU) has developed and published the AU Continental AI strategy, to assist with actualising Africa’s digital transformation. The policy document lays out a blueprint for AI regulation by African nations and has significant implications for how African nations approach the governance and oversight of AI technologies. The endorsed AU AI Policy provides a robust framework for ensuring AI's responsible and ethical use. It includes recommendations for industry-specific codes of conduct that outline best practices for designing, developing, and deploying AI systems. The continental strategy also calls for establishing technical standards and certification bodies to assess and benchmark AI applications, ensuring they meet rigorous safety, fairness, and transparency criteria. Recognizing the need for regulatory oversight, the Continental Strategy proposes mechanisms for testing and validating AI before it is implemented. This includes guidance for AU member states on establishing regulatory frameworks to scrutinize AI applications and provide approval for their use. It also encourages the creation of national AI councils to provide ongoing governance and decision-making around these transformative technologies. It is intended to serve as a model that AU member states can readily adopt. For countries without existing AI regulations, it offers a template that can quickly adapt to national AI strategies. For those already with AI policies, the endorsed AU AI Policy encourages alignment to promote consistency across the African Union. The continent already has a growing number of National AI Strategies: Egypt, Rwanda, Benin, Morocco, Mauritius, Sierra Leone, and Tunisia, with Nigeria and South Africa recently adding to the list of countries with National AI strategies. The development and utilisation of AI is prominent in the majority of the development plans of African states. However, despite these positive advancements, accessibility to these initiatives, specifically National AI policy plans, is limited, as they are not accessible within the public domain. We have only three accessible National AI policy plans: Egypt, Rwanda, and Mauritius. National strategies are held to be powerful and peculiar hybrid policies. The policy documents emulate the ‘national strategic positioning’ within the global space for various states whilst establishing their ‘national narrative’ on the regulation, utilisation and benefits of AI and its integration within their societies. The National AI Strategies assessed within the African context include: - 23 - 3.4.1.1. Egypt The National AI policy plan promotes Egypt's developmental agenda when discussing AI. The narrative of the plan is centred around a conscious approach. The strategy reflects the state's realities, as the plan is rooted in a SWOT analysis. The overarching goal is to exploit AI technologies to serve Egypt’s developmental goals and to foster regional and international cooperation. The mission is to effectively “create an AI industry in Egypt.” This requires people, technology, policy, and infrastructure. To actualize the above, the strategy has four pillars and four enablers. The pillars are AI for government, AI for development, capacity building and international relations. These pillars are underpinned by four enablers: governance, data, ecosystem, and infrastructure. 3.4.1.2. Mauritius The Mauritius Artificial Strategy Plan 2018 was the first strategy drafted by an African state. The plan is the guiding instrument that establishes the “cornerstone of the next national development model.” It assists in actualising the potential of AI to improve the economic growth, productivity, and quality of life for the Mauritian state. The main focal areas of the plan are centred around matching existing and new AI solutions to specific sectors and regions, establishing a ‘Mauritian unique selling point’ of AI, an appropriate ecosystem to nurture AI with a focus on creating collaborative communities, human capital to sustain the AI ecosystem and lastly a regulatory framework that acts as a catalyst for AI development and fiscal growth. 3.4.1.3. Rwanda The National Artificial Intelligence Policy is a roadmap to the state harnessing the benefits of AI as well as mitigating the potential risks of AI. The plan aligns with the current national plans: vision 2050 and Smart Rwanda Master Plan. This allows for a synergistic effect, as the plans concurrently work towards achieving the state's main goals. The plan is a catalyst for Rwanda harnessing AI for “sustainable and inclusive growth” as it seeks to mobilise local, regional, and international stakeholders, where mobilisation will assist with positioning the state to become a “leading African Innovation Hub and Africa’s Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence.” The policy fosters inclusive and sustainable socio-economic transformation rooted around the state's national agenda. National Context Currently, Kenya has no specific laws or regulations that singularly regulate AI. The Ministry of Information, Communications, and the Digital Economy is responsible for creating a National AI Strategy in collaboration with various partners. Previous policy efforts include the 2019 Distributed Ledgers (Blockchain) and Artificial Intelligence Taskforce Report, which investigated and evaluated these two emerging technologies with significant promise for revolutionising Kenya's economy. The Taskforce, in its Report, noted that the challenge in regulating AI is striking a balance between supporting innovation and competition while protecting consumers, market integrity, financial stability and human life. According to the Report, the emerging technologies rapidly reshaping the global economy include distributed ledgers (Blockchain), artificial intelligence (Al), and the Internet of Things (IoT). In an effort - 24 - to create a framework for regulating AI in Kenya, the Robotics Society of Kenya prepared the Kenya Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Society Bill 2023 with the aim of developing a framework that would regulate the use and adoption of AI in Kenya. Still, in draft form, the bill has lacked meaningful support from government, regulators, civil society, and private sector players. In addition to the aforementioned, on April 8, 2024, the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) released the Draft Information Technology Artificial Intelligence Code of Practice to ensure that the rights of citizens are upheld during the development of AI systems. Thus, the Code would assist organisations in the responsible development, provision, and use of AI once the Code is finalised and formally gazetted as a legal notice. Additionally, the code in establishing a governance framework will propose several standards aimed at supporting the National AI strategy and policies to be developed. The 10-year National Digital Master Plan 2022–2032, which follows the previous 2014-2017 (extended to 2022) master plan, sets the pace for Kenya’s continued adoption of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain technology and quantum computing to foster economic growth. The Master Plan highlights the need for a National AI Strategy, which would address the transformative role of AI on Kenya’s economy, the role of both levels of government in AI investments, facilitation of research and development for effective human-AI interactions, safety, access to datasets, ethical considerations, AI standards and evaluation tools, and human capital. The legal and regulatory atmosphere of AI reflects the urgent need for frameworks that balance innovation with ethical considerations and consumer protection. As AI technologies continue to advance, there is an increased necessity of establishing comprehensive regulations to govern their development and deployment. Globally, there has been a significant increase in the number of nations adopting AI-related laws, rising from 25 in 2022 to 127 in 2023. This surge indicates a growing acknowledgment of the potential risks and benefits associated with AI, prompting diverse legislative approaches tailored to specific regional contexts. In Kenya, while specific AI regulations are still in development, existing laws such as the Data Protection Act and the Consumer Protection Act provide a foundational framework for addressing issues related to AI. The National AI strategy signifies the first step towards addressing AI governance. The legal and regulatory atmosphere for AI is characterised by a dynamic interplay of innovation, ethical considerations, and consumer protection. Notably, as nations continue to develop and refine their regulatory frameworks, the focus remains on fostering an environment that encourages technological advancement while prioritising the rights and safety of individuals. 3.5. Kenya’s AI Readiness Assessment Kenya’s AI readiness occurs within the global context, where various indices have rated countries’ readiness for AI adoption based on factors such as data, infrastructure, talent, research and innovation, governance, partnerships, and ethical capabilities to handle the adoption of AI. Kenya has been rated within a variety of these indices, checking on safety, government AI readiness, amongst others. For instance, according to the UNESCO Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) on AI Report, the private sector in Kenya is adopting AI-powered solutions at an increasing rate. AI - 25 - developments have driven innovation and efficiency across the finance, agriculture, healthcare, and education sectors, significantly improving decision-making processes, automation, and data analysis. The Assessment is based on five core assessment areas (legal and regulatory dimension, social and cultural dimension, scientific and educational dimension, economic dimension, and the technological and infrastructural dimension) aimed at giving holistic insights into Kenya’s status progress and preparedness. A summary of the findings from the assessment appear in the table xx: Table 3.x: Results of UNESCO AI Readiness for Kenya Core Assessment Area Findings Legal and Regulatory Dimension Kenya has foundational legal frameworks, such as the Data Protection Act (2019), which regulates automated decision-making and protects individual privacy. The Kenyan Constitution (2010) promotes equality and the rights of marginalized groups, supporting inclusive AI development. There is a recognized need for comprehensive AI-specific regulations to address ethical implications and potential harms. Institutional and human capacity building is essential for effective implementation and enforcement of regulatory frameworks. Social – Cultural Dimension There is significant underrepresentation of women and minorities in the AI field, limiting diverse perspectives. Public awareness and engagement are critical for building trust and acceptance of AI technologies. Ethical considerations are central, with a call for frameworks that respect cultural norms and societal values. Without intentional efforts to promote equity, AI could exacerbate existing social disparities. Scientific and Educational Dimension There is a need for a robust research and development ecosystem to foster AI innovation. Increased investment and a coordinated approach are necessary to enhance AI research output and impact. The availability of AI-related educational programs is limited, necessitating expansion to meet job market demands. Emphasis on developing curricula aligned with industry needs and promoting STEM education to produce a skilled workforce. Economic Dimension The number of AI startups and companies is growing, indicating a developing market. Increased public and private investment in AI initiatives is essential for driving innovation and competitiveness. The ICT sector, including AI, contributes significantly to Kenya's GDP, with projections for greater future impacts. There is a critical gap in the labour market, with demand for ICT and AI skills far exceeding supply. Technological and Infrastructural Dimension The presence of data centres and cloud computing capabilities is essential for supporting AI applications. The report notes that while there are some existing resources, further investment and development are necessary to meet the increasing demands of AI technologies. As of early 2024, Kenya had approximately 22.71 million internet users, with a penetration rate of 40.8%. 98% of the population was covered by at least 2G mobile network technology, but access to 5G was limited (0.6%). - 26 - Gender disparity in internet usage reflects broader accessibility issues, hindering inclusive AI growth. Challenges related to data sharing and accessibility are significant barriers to AI innovation. Additionally, Kenya’s readiness according the Oxford Insights Government AI Readiness Index in 2023 appears in summary in table 3.x: Table 3.x: Kenya’ AI readiness - Oxford … Category Findings Relevant Scores and Statistics Data Noting the importance of data in AI adoption, Kenya lacks sufficient data to train AI models, scoring low on the global index. Kenya scored 44.44% on data availability in the 2023 Oxford Insights Government AI Readiness Index and 63.67% on data representativeness. Infrastructure Significant investment in connectivity and infrastructure development is noted through the establishment of the National Data Centre. The government has constructed around 8900 km of terrestrial fiber during the past ten years, much of which has reached the sub-county level and connects important government offices and institutions. 2023 Oxford Insights Government AI Readiness Index ranked Kenya 101st worldwide with a 40.19% score. Kenya’s data and infrastructure score is 51.58% which is average but categorized as low Talent Kenya notes a significant gap between the high demand for AI skills and the limited number of qualified professionals due to low STEM enrolment. Current educational programs in AI at universities and technical institutions are inadequate to meet industry needs. Only 25% of university graduates complete a STEM course. Research and Innovation Kenya's AI landscape underscores the critical need for a unified strategy to advance the field. Current research efforts in AI are disjointed and lack adequate funding, highlighting the necessity for increased investment from both public and private sectors to remain competitive on a global scale. Kenya scored 48.8% in innovation capacity as per 2023 Oxford Insights AI Readiness Index. Comparatively, Sub-Saharan Africa scored 32.93% in innovation capacity. Governance and Ethical AI Adoption Emphasis is made on key readiness aspects such as capacity development and innovation, ethics and responsible AI practices, standardisation and collaboration to promote data interoperability and sharing characterised by the The AI Practitioners' Guide (2023), developed by a multi-stakeholder AI practitioners’ group (Community of Practice), Kenya still lack AI specific regulations. Kenya scored 40.19% in the government pillar of the 2023 Oxford Insights Government AI Readiness, which denotes government readiness to adopt AI in public services. - 27 - Partnerships Collaborative efforts from a multi-stakeholder group are noted towards regulatory readiness Key observation, no percentage scoring - 28 - 3.6. Key findings from primary data collection This section presents findings from a comprehensive data collection process that engaged a diverse range of stakeholders across Kenya’s AI ecosystem. The insights are drawn from government representatives, industry leaders, academia, civil society, and the public through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, expert consultations, town hall sessions, and an online survey. These approaches provided a nuanced understanding of strategic priorities, opportunities, and challenges that can be addressed by the strategy. Key Informant Interviews The Key Informant Interviews(KIIs) identified a number of strengths, challenges, limitations and considerations that the strategy should take into account to ensure effective implementation. Key informant interviews revealed a strong belief in Kenya’s potential to become a leader in AI innovation. Participants highlighted the country’s vibrant startup ecosystem, growing digital literacy, and access to renewable energy as significant strengths. The nation's pioneering spirit makes it an attractive location for global AI pilot projects and position it as a regional hub. Over 40,000 people have received AI training, entrenching Kenya as a hub of youthful talent ready to harness the power of AI. Furthermore, the availability of green energy sources like geothermal power presents opportunities to build regional data centres that are sustainable. Kenya has already demonstrated its capability to leverage technology in crisis response, as seen in flood management efforts and the swift transition to remote learning during COVID-19. These successes further position Kenya to potentially lead neighbouring countries in AI development and implementation. However, a lack of quality and digitised data, infrastructural gaps, and public mistrust in AI systems pose significant barriers to widespread adoption of AI. Participants expressed concerns over the ethical use of AI, particularly regarding data privacy, misinformation, and bias. Many of those interviewed called for clear policy direction and increased efforts in raising citizen awareness to ensure AI delivers tangible benefits to all Kenyans, increased public trust and responsible use of AI. The respondents also noted that currently donors have limited coordination in supporting the AI ecosystem, and there's a notable power imbalance with big tech companies operating in the region unproportionally wielding influence and inequitable opportunities for smaller SMEs in the AI ecosystem. Despite having many Kenyans working in AI, many remain stuck in bottom-of-pyramid and entry level jobs such as data annotation, indicating a need for better career progression pathways. Small tech companies struggle with limited access to capital and financing, and energy poverty and associated costs remain ongoing concerns for scaling a local AI ecosystem. Access and availability of data presents another significant challenge, with limitations in quality, quantity, and data sharing mechanisms. Outdated record keeping practices, manual processes in government and limited digitization of official records limits the ability of government to tap into to train contextually relevant models. Infrastructure gaps and AI skills gaps of government officials could also limit the government from harnessing the full potential of AIs and maintaining procured systems. - 29 - Respondents also noted that while Kenya has ambitious goals for AI, these efforts are often underfunded and lack a unified strategy. They made recommendations that the national AI strategy be inclusive of stakeholder input and ethical safeguards. Additionally, respondents recommended fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between industry, government and academia, building repositories of local datasets for AI applications, and creating transparent financing models to support startups and innovators. There was an emphasis on transparency in AI deployment and decision-making and the efficient utilisation of national resources processes to build public trust in AI-based systems. Stakeholders emphasised the importance of ensuring AI development leaves no one behind, as those left behind may never recover. On governance, several respondents stated that Kenya needs testing and sandboxing platforms for AI development. It was also necessary to define AI safety in the context of the Global South as well as establish principles for safe, ethical, and inclusive AI implementation in Kenya. Clear lines of responsibility and accountability for AI deployments and decision-making also need to be established. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) The FGDs further contextualised and supported the insights arising from the KIIs, focusing on inclusivity and the socio-economic implications of AI. In several FGD sessions, participants stressed the importance of embedding local contexts into AI systems, including incorporating indigenous knowledge and local languages. The discussions highlighted the importance of incorporating Afrocentric views and values into AI development, with a strong emphasis on local production and civic education. Participants also highlighted that AI systems should be built with representative data that reflects African diversity and contexts. This approach would not only make AI more accessible but also ensure its relevance to Kenya’s unique challenges. Data sovereignty emerged as a critical theme. Participants stressed the need for local data processing capabilities and robust frameworks to secure and manage data effectively. Concerns about the reliance on foreign data centres and their implications for Kenya’s digital independence were repeatedly raised in different forums. Opportunities were identified in sectors like agriculture, education, and health, where AI could enhance service delivery and create jobs. For instance, AI-powered systems could help farmers improve crop yields and enable more efficient healthcare diagnostics. However, participants cautioned against overregulation, which could stifle innovation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The FGDs also highlighted the urgent need for capacity building. Kenya has a shortage of specialised AI professionals, and academic institutions often lag in aligning their curricula with industry needs. The academic FGD raised concerns about curriculum development and funding challenges, particularly in public universities. Participants advocated for collaborative AI innovation hubs and strong public-private innovation networks. Recommendations included introducing AI education at earlier levels of schooling, promoting research funding, and fostering international partnerships for knowledge exchange.

There were divergent views among respondents regarding AI regulation. One group emphasized the importance of allowing AI to develop its potential before imposing regulations, with public participation shaping policy. In contrast, another group stressed the need for clear policies, laws, and a national strategy to ensure ethical AI development from the outset. A majority of respondents underscored the necessity of transparency in AI decision-making processes to build public trust. They advocated for AI algorithms to be subject to public scrutiny. Moreover, respondents called for public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about AI, its benefits, risks, and ethical implications. Inclusivity emerged as a crucial consideration, with respondents urging that AI systems be designed to consider diverse populations to ensure equitable outcomes. Additionally, there was a strong demand for independent bodies to oversee AI implementation, evaluate AI projects, and conduct regular impact assessments on the effects of AI deployments. 3.7. Stakeholder Analysis Background Stakeholder mapping is a crucial process in developing a national AI strategy, involving identifying and analysing individuals, groups, and organisations that have an interest or stake in the strategy's outcomes. According to Bryson (2004), stakeholder mapping systematically identifies and analyses stakeholders to understand their influence and importance in decision- making processes. This process helps recognise the diverse perspectives, interests, and potential impacts on various sectors of society, ensuring that the strategy is comprehensive and inclusive. The primary purpose of stakeholder mapping is to facilitate effective engagement, foster collaboration, and mitigate risks by understanding the needs and expectations of different stakeholders. Doing so ensures that the AI strategy is aligned with national priorities, ethical standards, and the long-term goals of sustainable development. Justification This stakeholder mapping exercise is based on the following theoretical frameworks - the normative stakeholder theory and the evolving theory of property. To contextualise the AI ecosystem, an African lens is applied in the exercise of when mapping stakeholders, which - 32 - presents the ideology that the African AI ecosystem can be described by identifying stakeholders categorised based on normative claims. The normative claims derive from the normative stakeholder theory, which is a critical guide in ethical decision-making in the AI ecosystem. This theory centres on prioritising stakeholders and identifying their obligations and responsibilities. The normative claim is based on the evolving theory of property, which posits that property rights are embedded in human rights, necessitating the consideration of the interests of all stakeholders, including non-owner stakeholders. Stakeholders are categorised based on the normative claims they can make on the AI system, focusing on fair economic opportunity, political equality, and authenticity. This approach emphasises the importance of considering ethical and moral considerations in decision-making processes related to AI development, adoption, and policy formulation. The normative stakeholder theory identifies a range of potential obligations that corporations operating in developing countries may take on, focusing on the commitments of groups of stakeholders rather than individual entities in specific situations. Therefore, in bringing this together to define responsible AI, the strategy defines responsible AI within Africa by emphasising the importance of considering diverse perspectives and ensuring equitable outcomes for all stakeholders involved in the AI ecosystem. Responsible AI, in this framework, involves addressing power dynamics, information asymmetries, and intersecting interests among stakeholders to create an AI ecosystem that is fair, inclusive, and beneficial to everyone. The focus is on identifying disparities in power, understanding relationships and power dynamics between different groups, and ensuring that the development and adoption of AI technology consider the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders. By characterising stakeholders' interactions, interests, responsibilities, and accountability, the aim is to promote responsible AI practices, prioritising equity and inclusivity. Following from this, these are the eight main groups considered during the stakeholder mapping and their indices based on their interest and influence over this strategy document: Stakeholder Mapping and Identification of Influence No. Stakeholder Actors Interest Index: High or Low Influence Index: High or Low Implication 1 Developers ASSEK, COP, TESPOK, Consultancy firms H H Must be involved 2 Customers (purchasers) Private Sector- KEPSA, KAM, KBA Government: Ministries, Departments and Agencies Citizens H L Involved periodically - 33 - 3 Communities KICTANet, COP AI, COP DPI, EAC, EALA, AU, National Assembly, LSK L H Keep informed 4 Regulatory Agencies Office of the Data Protection Commissioner The Competition Authority of Kenya Commission on Administrative Justice KEBS National Computer and Cybercrimes Coordination Committee (NC4) Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI) Kenya Copyright Board Central Bank of Kenya L H Keep informed 5 Researchers Academia University of Nairobi USIU JKUAT Strathmore University K-AIST Other universities ACTS Non- academic/commercial MARI Moringa AI Kenya LDRI H H Must be involved - 34 - 6 Investors (Financiers/Developmen t Partners) Development Partners FCDO IDRC GIZ EU USAID Government Private Sector Venture Capital and Private Equity firms H H Must be involved 7 Infrastructure providers Liquid Telecom Google Microsoft NVIDIA Ministry of ICTDE H L Involved periodically 8 Media and Advertising Agencies Media Council Editors Guild Marketing Society of Kenya L L Inform periodically This mapping prioritizes the stakeholder groupings that ‘must be involved’ and should be kept informed.

SLOC Summary Tables 3.x1 to 3.x4 show a summary of the synthesis of the information obtained from the various analyses reported in this chapter in the form of strengths, limitations, opportunities and limitations (SLOC). The key evidence behind its selection of each of the SLOC elements is also provided. Strengths Strengths Key Evidence - 36 - Existing diverse and vibrant local innovation ecosystem There is a vibrant ecosystem of local start-ups in creating AI solutions tailored to Kenyan needs. The stakeholder mapping shows diverse input and actors in AI development and innovation in Kenya. The innovation ecosystem is developing home-grown and localised solutions that are contextually relevant in sectors such as health, agriculture and fintech. Major international technology companies including Microsoft, Google, Meta, Huawei and NVIDIA have made significant investments into the local ecosystem through the establishment of data centres and AI labs, which bolster the local AI ecosystem, enhance Kenya’s AI capabilities, provide access to global best practices while facilitating technology transfer and improving competitiveness. Young digital-ready AI workforce Kenya has a large, young workforce already actively engaging in technology and now, AI. This work force has basic training and high digital literacy, which provide a base for developing advanced AI capabilities and fostering innovation as AI workforce demand increases both domestically and internationally. Some of these workers are already supporting international companies such as Sama in the development of AI through outsourced data processing and labelling. Foundational legal framework for ethical AI development and use Kenya has robust existing legal frameworks including the Data Protection Act, The Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act that provide direction on aspects of AI development and use. These regulatory frameworks enable initial trust in AI systems and some redress mechanisms for misuse and AI harms. Kenya also has conducive policies that create an enabling environment for AI development and prioritising emerging technologies including the National Digital Economy Blueprint, where AI is referenced as a tool for driving innovation-driven entrepreneurship and the Kenya National Digital Master Plan (2022-2032). - 37 - Existing digital infrastructure Kenya has a robust digital infrastructure set up including a number of private and government data centres, fibre infrastructure and high levels of mobile infrastructure and internet penetration that supports small scale AI development and deployment. Kenya also has access to clean and green energy, particularly geothermal, which provides a strategic advantage in developing AI infrastructure, such as green data centres with minimal environmental impact. Political will and strong government support for the adoption of AI The government has provided political backing for the development of AI in Kenya through participation and ratification of global events and issues on AI and; prioritisation of AI through the set up of the 2019 Distributed Ledgers (Blockchain) and Artificial Intelligence Taskforce, the set up of the Sectoral Working Group as well as the development of a national AI strategy. The government has mobilised financing and resources for local AI development by facilitating strategic investments from international partners e.g. the commitment by Microsoft and G42 for a $1 billion digital ecosystem initiative to set up green infrastructure and local language models. There are also existing initiatives in the public sector including the set up of the AI-powered Konza smart city, the use of AI in healthcare resource allocation and deployment of chatbots that support digital service delivery and citizen engagement. Kenya is a regional hub/gateway to the East & Central Africa region The presence of homegrown companies and tech startups building AI tools as well as global tech companies setting up research centers provides evidence of Kenya’s status as a regional leader. Kenya’s existing digital infrastructure, such as the National Optic Fibre Backbone Network Initiative, aim to enhance connectivity across all counties, making it an attractive destination for technology companies interested in expanding to the region to set base in Kenya. Kenya’s commitments to building smart cities, like Konza Technopolis, and existing partnerships for AI training and innovation also demonstrate its capacity as a regional leader. Limitations - 38 - Limitations Key Evidence AI-Skills Gap Kenya faces a huge shortage of advanced-level AI experts with the skills to design and train contextually relevant models for AI. This skills gap can slow down AI development, limit innovation, and force reliance on foreign expertise, thereby reducing Kenya’s competitiveness in AI. Primary data collection also indicates existing mismatches between academic training and practical industry needs that limit the ability to further homegrown innovation and effective adoption and maintenance of AI technologies. (Expand this definition to include different types of skills to include non tech professionals) Regulatory gaps and regulatory conflicts Kenya does not have a comprehensive and specific regulatory framework for AI. While existing legal frameworks such as the Data Protection, Computer Misuse and Cybercrime, Intellectual Property and Consumers Acts provide some guidance, they are insufficient to address the complexities of AI. There is no specific policy on AI. These fragmented policy and regulatory gaps create governance challenges in managing ethical concerns, data privacy, and the safe deployment of AI technologies.It may hinder the responsible development and deployment of AI, potentially increasing the risk of misuse, harm to the citizen or unintended consequences from the deployment of AI. In addition, this creates uncertainty which is deterring investment, innovation and adoption of AI by certain industries including the public sector. Kenya’s current regulatory environment for AI is fragmented, with multiple bodies working independently without a unified approach. This fragmentation leads to inconsistencies and inefficiencies in AI governance, making it challenging to create a cohesive strategy for AI development and deployment. The absence of robust AI-specific governance frameworks also limits public sector adoption of AI as well as adoption of AI in regulated sectors where errors and harms from AI deployment could diminish public trust, inequality and quality of service provision. - 39 - Data quality, availability and accessibility concerns Despite the presence of digital infrastructure, Kenya struggles with data availability and quality, which are critical for training effective AI models. The country ranks low on data availability indices, reflecting challenges in accessing and utilising data for AI development. Where data exists e.g. in government ministries and departments, it is not fully digitalised and exists in silos. It is also underutilised due to gaps in data governance policies that enable data sharing and collaboration, limiting the potential for data-driven innovation and comprehensive AI solutions. Primary and supporting infrastructure constraints While Kenya has made progress in developing its digital infrastructure, challenges remain in terms of data accessibility and the availability of computing power needed for AI applications. These infrastructure limitations could slow down AI adoption and limit the scalability of AI-driven solutions across the country. Kenya faces challenges related to insufficient computing power, broadband connectivity, and energy efficiency, which hinder large-scale AI deployment including the deployment of large language models. These infrastructure constraints limit the scalability and effectiveness of AI initiatives and impede Kenya’s ability to implement AI solutions effectively across sectors. Inadequate infrastructure and unreliable infrastructure such as network reliability and consistent electricity and water supply, poses a significant barrier to the effective deployment and scalability of AI technologies across the country. Additionally, the slow progress in digitising documents and records from government and other key sectors will delay the adoption of AI technologies. This challenge has hampered the efficient delivery of public services and will limit the ability to leverage AI for data-driven decision-making and innovation within the public sector. - 40 - Limited investments in local AI, research and development The AI readiness assessments note under-investments in local AI research and development (R&D). Additionally, startups and universities face funding constraints and limited access to venture capital and development financing to scale AI projects. AI projects are inherently expensive. This curtails growth of local innovations, diminishes competitiveness, and hinders the creation of contextually relevant AI solutions. The Kenyan AI ecosystem heavily relies on funding and support from international organizations and private companies, which may limit the sustainability and autonomy of local AI initiatives. The lack of government-funded AI research highlights a critical gap that could undermine the long-term development and independence of the national AI ecosystem. Ensuring equity and inclusion in AI development and gaps in public AI/digital literacy Despite efforts by the government and private sector players, there remains significant gaps in digital and AI literacy among the general population. This limits public engagement with AI technologies, reducing the adoption of AI-driven solutions and the potential to widen socio-economic inequalities. The digital divide in Kenya, particularly between urban and rural areas and among marginalised communities, poses a significant challenge to the inclusive adoption of AI technologies. Without targeted efforts to bridge this divide, AI adoption could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, limiting the benefits of AI to a small segment of the population. Additionally, there will be a challenge in building public trust and awareness, an important element for the successful adoption of AI, as it ensures that citizens are informed, engaged, and confident in using AI technologies Kenya also faces a challenge from the existing gender imbalances and the underrepresentation of marginalized groups in the development and deployment of AI technologies who are necessary to ensure diversity in development of AI and that the benefits of AI are shared broadly across all segments of society. There is significant underrepresentation of women and minorities in the AI sector, limiting the diversity of perspectives and innovation in AI development. This underrepresentation may exacerbate existing social inequalities and hinder the creation of inclusive AI solutions that address the needs of all segments of society. - 41 - Fragmented/uncoordinate d prioritisation of development and application of AI There is a potential for unbalanced prioritisation of AI initiatives with certain sectors receiving more attention and resources than others based on political considerations rather than strategic needs. This concern was raised by both government representatives and innovators. This could stifle innovation, create disparities in AI development across sectors, and undermine the effectiveness of AI initiatives Opportunities Opportunities Key Evidence Job creation and economic growth potential AI has shown the potential to significantly boost global GDPs by improving efficiency and productivity in sectors and creating new jobs. The Kenyan economy is undergoing significant challenges and fraught with reduced incomes and increased job losses. The adoption of AI in critical sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and finance has led to significant improvements in operational efficiency and service delivery. For example, AI-driven platforms like Apollo Agriculture enhance agricultural productivity, while AI in healthcare supports disease diagnosis and patient management. These innovations not only boost sectoral performance but also contribute to the broader socio-economic development of Kenya. Sector-specific AI implementations can address unique challenges in these areas, driving improvements in efficiency, productivity, and service delivery. AI-driven economic growth can enhance Kenya’s global competitiveness, create a new industry and job opportunities, and drive inclusive economic development. These new jobs created by an AI sector can address unemployment, especially among the youth, and contribute to economic stability and growth. - 42 - AI role in enhancing public sector efficiency AI presents an opportunity to significantly improve public sector efficiency in Kenya by automating processes, enhancing decision- making, and reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies. This could lead to more transparent, accountable, and responsive public services, thereby increasing citizen trust and engagement. Various primary interviews have identified the government as an anchor of demand for AI solutions. The government’s role as a primary AI adopter can stimulate the market, drive innovation, and create a sustainable demand for AI solutions across various sectors. Strengthening existing policy and regulations Kenya has the opportunity to develop and implement ethical AI frameworks that address concerns related to bias, discrimination, and data privacy. By leading in the creation of responsible AI practices, Kenya can set an example for other countries in the region and establish itself as a hub for ethical AI innovation. Given that AI is still an evolving technology there are opportunities to set up agile environments such as regulatory sandboxes for safe AI development and testing. These environments support innovation by providing a controlled environment for developing and testing AI technologies, therefore, accelerating their safe and effective deployment. An example includes the Draft Information Technology Artificial Intelligence Code of Practice. AI-Specific Education Programs There is an opportunity to develop AI-specific curricula and training programs. Building a skilled workforce through rapid upskilling, reskilling and AI-specific education ensures Kenya can meet the future demands of the AI industry, fostering sustainable growth and innovation. The development of AI-specific curricula and training programs can also help address the existing skills gap, leading to job creation and a more skilled workforce. Kenyan universities and institutions, such as Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and Strathmore University already offer specialized AI programs. Additionally, initiatives like Huawei's AI Certification and the Jitume Digital Hub contribute to building a skilled workforce, ensuring that Kenya has the talent needed to sustain and grow its AI sector. These programs can be further enhanced by leveraging international partnerships that allow Kenya to bridge the skills gap through targeted capacity-building programs and aligned training to industry needs. - 43 - Public-Private Partnerships Expanding public-private partnerships and collaborative projects between government, private sector, and academia can accelerate AI development by leveraging resources and expertise from each sector.

There are already a number of open data repositories including from the National Bureau of Statistics. Streamlined development of this data infrastructure and existing repositories can enhance AI research, enable the development of high-quality AI solutions, and improve decision-making processes across sectors. There is also an opportunity to develop local language models which can democratise access to AI, making it more inclusive and relevant to the Kenyan population, while preserving linguistic diversity. Kenya has the opportunity to harness local industry and capital to support AI research and academia. By encouraging collaboration between businesses, investors, and educational institutions, Kenya can foster homegrown innovation, drive AI advancements, and strengthen its research capacity. This approach can reduce reliance on external funding, empower local talent, and accelerate the development of AI solutions tailored to Kenya’s needs. - 44 - Leadership in AI development (models, responsible AI, policy) Emerging applications in agriculture (e.g., crop disease detection), healthcare (e.g., medical imaging analysis), and financial inclusion have exhibited Kenya’s ability to develop AI solutions tailored to African contexts. Several global tech companies have also established research centers in Kenya, focusing on local AI model development. Stakeholders interviewed in the primary data collection exercise advocated for embedding Afrocentric values and indigenous knowledge into AI systems to ensure relevance and inclusivity, showcasing Kenya’s leadership potential in contextual AI development. Additionally, Kenya has foundational legal frameworks, like the Data Protection Act demonstrating Kenya’s potential to lead in crafting AI policy for emerging markets. Kenya has access to renewable energy (e.g., geothermal) create a unique opportunity for leadership in sustainable AI development. Challenges Challenges Key Evidence Data Governance and Data Sovereignty Kenya relies heavily on foreign data centres to process and store datasets produced in the country and about Kenyans, raising concerns about data sovereignty and the potential for external entities to control or influence key AI data. This dependence on external entities for data storage and management raises concerns about the potential loss of control over critical AI data, which could expose the country to data exploitation, external manipulation, privacy breaches, dependency on external AI solutions, and national security threats. Without strong data governance, Kenya may struggle to protect its citizens' data rights and maintain trust in AI systems. Strengthening these frameworks is essential to safeguard national interests and ensure the integrity of AI initiatives. - 45 - Labour market disruption and job displacement The adoption of AI technologies in Kenya creates the potential for widespread job displacement, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and services, where a large portion of the population is currently employed. This creates the need for reskilling and upskilling initiatives to mitigate the risk of exacerbating unemployment and deepening social inequalities. Additionally, the risk of brain drain among skilled AI professionals further exacerbates this challenge, as top talent may seek opportunities abroad for better pay, leaving gaps in the local AI workforce.If not managed effectively, the brain drain of skilled AI professionals could limit Kenya’s ability to build and sustain a competitive AI ecosystem. Global regulatory pressure There is a lag in defining comprehensive ethical and legal frameworks both locally and internationally. As AI rapidly advances, there are challenges understanding and scoping evolving AI risks including the risks of bias, discrimination, and potential misuse for surveillance and other invasive purposes. Different regions are therefore adopting varied approaches to AI regulation from AI legislation to sector specific regulation. These diverse approaches create pressure for Kenya to decide which models to follow or how to develop its own unique approach while at the same time remaining globally competitive. Particularly, it presents a challenge of balancing an enabling environment for innovation to address Kenya's unique socio-economic context, creating a framework that aligns with international best practice for regulating risks associated with AI technologies, and preserving citizens’ rights. - 46 - Cap on competitiveness in AI technology (Global) - supply chain on AI technology The concentration of AI investments and research in advanced economies like the US, China, Japan, India, and Germany is accelerating the pace of global AI innovation. The rapid advancement of AI capabilities in these leading nations outpaces local development in Kenya, potentially widening the technological gap and making it increasingly difficult for the country to compete on the global AI stage. Global supply chains for acquiring essential AI components such as high-performance GPUs and specialised AI chips are often dominated by a few key players in developed economies. Limited access to these resources, due to factors like export controls, high costs, or supply shortages, can significantly hinder Kenya's ability to develop and deploy state-of-the-art AI systems and increase operational costs. This dependence on external resources for core AI infrastructure could slow down local innovation and make it more challenging for Kenya to develop a self-reliant AI ecosystem. Cybersecurity and misinformation/disinformatio n From the global environmental analysis where AI technologies are exploited for cyber-attacks, such as automated phishing and enhanced hacking techniques. Kenya faces similar risks due to its expanding digital and AI ecosystems The reliance on external data centers can compromise data sovereignty and expose Kenya to cross-border cyber risks. The rise of generative AI technologies, such as deep fakes, poses risks for creating and spreading false narratives, undermining trust in media and institutions Kenya’s regulatory frameworks for addressing cybersecurity and misinformation are still evolving, leaving gaps in mitigating these challenges - 47 - 4.
