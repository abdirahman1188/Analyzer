Hamza Abdi Barre Prime Minister Federal Government of Somalia 1 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This National Transformation Plan I (NTP I), 2025–2029, marks a momentous milestone as we embark on a transformative journey for Somalia. The NTP I sets clear targets and accountability measures to propel our nation toward prosperity and stability for all Somalis. A year ago, my Cabinet came together to align on the national priorities that would shape this plan. This is not merely a ceremonial launch—my Cabinet and I are fully committed to delivering on the outcomes outlined within. The National Transformation Plan is designed to endure beyond our time in office, offering concrete strategies to chart a new course for our people. Our ambitions are bold, but they are grounded in necessity. The plan prioritises creating jobs, improving socio-economic conditions, and strengthening governance. Central to its vision is fostering private sector development, supported by the public sector, to drive sustainable and inclusive growth. Our overarching goals include generating employment, reducing poverty and inequality, addressing climate change, and promoting gender equity—not as mere aspirations, but as essential pillars of all future development efforts. To achieve these objectives, the government has engaged a diverse range of experts—domestic and international—to craft actionable solutions. This process draws on proven methodologies used successfully in other countries, including our neighbours. The result is a roadmap designed to deliver swift, impactful outcomes across key sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, energy, education, healthcare, and logistics. Attracting investment remains a cornerstone of this strategy. Through a Call for Projects, we aim to engage global partners and local businesses to drive high-impact investments into Somalia. We are committed to fostering an environment that encourages private sector growth, bolstered by institutional reforms and regulatory enhancements. These efforts will unlock substantial private investments, boost GDP, and create thousands of jobs, ensuring long-term sustainability. However, we recognise the challenges faced by Somalia's private sector. It remains nascent, with gaps in experience, access to resources, and formalisation. Public service delivery and the business environment require significant improvement to support private sector expansion. Addressing these obstacles is central to achieving the inclusive economic growth envisioned in this Plan. Somalia today is not defined solely by the crises often highlighted in external narratives. While challenges persist, we are also a nation of resilience and ambition. My Government has invested considerable effort in addressing these persistent issues, reinforcing the need for this Plan’s success. Collaboration across all levels of government and society will be vital to overcoming barriers and unlocking Somalia’s potential. Critics may question whether this Plan will result in tangible outcomes. I assure you it will. Unlike past initiatives, this Plan demands accountability and commitment at every level. This is not just a government initiative—it is a call to action for all Somalis. Together, we must transcend political and clan divisions to unite in tackling shared challenges such as hunger, disease, climate change, and insecurity. This mission is about building a just, prosperous, and stable Somalia for current and future generations. I call upon all public and private stakeholders to collaborate in the spirit of partnership, identifying actionable solutions that foster sustainable growth and development. Our aspirations must be bold, and our actions decisive. It is through this collective effort that we will redefine Somalia’s future. With that, I commend the National Transformation Plan I: 2025– 2029 to your care. It is my hope and expectation that this Plan will serve as a guiding beacon for the continued progress of our beloved nation. Hon. Mohamud A. Sheikh Farah (Beenebeene) Minsiter of Planning, Investment and Economic development 1 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Foreword by the Minister It is with great pleasure that I present the National Transformation Plan (NTP) for the period 2025–2029. Somalia has a distinguished history of formulating national development plans, beginning in 1962, to articulate the country’s long-term development objectives, provide a cohesive framework for sustainable socio-economic growth, and foster a comprehensive approach to national development. The NTP builds upon this rich legacy, drawing valuable lessons from the past, particularly from the National Development Plan 9 (NDP-9), while setting an ambitious course for the future, one that inclusivity, resilience, and sustainable development as cornerstones of Somalia’s continued progress. The Ministry of Planning, Investment, and Economic Development (MoPIED) has been at the forefront of developing, planning, coordinating, monitoring, and evaluating the country’s development plan. As the NDP-9 concludes, the National Transformation Plan (NTP) takes effect, building upon the progress achieved under the NDP-9, while addressing the gaps and challenges encountered in its implementation, thereby laying a solid foundation for sustained and inclusive national growth. Despite facing unprecedented challenges, including the global COVID-19 pandemic and recurring climatic shocks, the poverty analysis generated from the SIHBS-2022 showed 54.4% of the Somali population live below the poverty line unlike the 2nd Somali High Frequency Survey that indicated 69% poverty rate. the Ministry takes pride in key milestones and agrees that poverty is deepest in the rural areas and IDP settlements and there is a need for more targeted programs to improve people’s livelihoods. Building on the lessons learned from the implementation of the NDP-9, the government has adopted a transformative approach in designing and developing the National Transformation Plan (2025–2029). Central to this approach is the use of the lab approach, a highly participatory process for stakeholder engagement, which was crucial for collaboration, coordination, and effective implementation of sector-level initiatives. The culmination of this transformative approach is a series of programs and projects, developed through the lab process, that are designed to transform key sectors and contribute to sustainable development, particularly in alignment with the long-term country’s Centennial Vision 2060 as well as regional, continental and global goals. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to President H.E. Dr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister H.E. Hamza Abdi Barre for their visionary leadership and strategic guidance during the formulation of the National Transformation Plan (NTP). Their unwavering commitment to driving Somalia’s development agenda has been instrumental in shaping the NTP and ensuring it aligns with the country’s longterm Centennial Vision 2060. I would also like to express my heartfelt appreciation to everyone who contributed to the successful development of the National Transformation Plan (NTP). A special acknowledgment and appreciation go to the Director General of the Ministry of Planning, Mr. Mohamed Shire, the Permanent Secretary of the Office of the Prime Minister, Mr. Kamal Gutale, the Deputy Permanent Secretary, Mr. Abdirizack Ali Ibrahim, the Director of the Planning Department, Muse Mohamed, and Mr. Abdi Osman, the NTP Coordinator. Their unwavering commitment, expertise, and leadership were instrumental in shaping the NTP and ensuring its successful formulation and alignment with the country’s development priorities. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge and appreciate all dedicated civil servants from across Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) at the Federal and Federal Member States levels, local and international partners, private sector stakeholders, and civil society organizations for their unwavering commitment and the significant role they have played throughout the NTP formulation process. 12 Special thanks go to the pillar-technical leads, whose expertise, dedication, and collaborative spirit were pivotal in crafting this plan. These individuals include Ms. Ambia Guhad Noor, Abdulkadir Yassin Hassan (Cigaal), Mohamed Weli Ahmed, Mohamed Abdi Omar, Dr. Hussein Yussuf Ali, Mahdi Omar Sheikh, Hussein Abdillahi Suleiman and Fouzia Warsame. Their collective efforts have been essential to the successful development of the NTP. Finally, as we embark on the implementation of this ambitious plan, I call upon all stakeholders, including Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), development partners, private sector entities, and civil society organisations, to actively collaborate in achieving the transformative goals outlined in the National Transformation Plan. It is only through collective action, coordination, and a shared vision that we can realise the full potential of this plan and drive the sustainable development of our nation. Together, we will overcome challenges and unlock new opportunities for growth, prosperity, and resilience. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 INTRODUCTION The National Transformation Plan (NTP 2025-2029) is a ground-breaking, inspirational, and forward-looking document that will propel Somalia into a promising future. The plan envisions a Somalia with stable and inclusive governance, anchored on the rule of law, and a thriving, sustainable economy that can provide high-quality services and contribute to the well-being of its citizens. The NTP is centred around four key pillars, which are: Transformational Governance Pillar 1. Sustainable Economic Transformation Pillar 2. Social and Human Capital Transformation Pillar 3. Environment and Climate Resilience Pillar 4. 2 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Being a medium-term blueprint for an economically vibrant, socially thriving, environmentally resilient, and democratically stable Somalia, the development of the NTP is motivated by the collective aspirations for a better and prosperous Somalia as the country progresses towards sustainable transformation. The NTP aligns with Somalia’s Centennial Vision 2060: to create a prosperous, secure, democratic, inclusive, and competitive country with a high-quality life. In pursuit of that vision, the goal of the NTP is to consolidate peace and create sustainable economic growth and improved social well-being by achieving the following core objectives: Establish and strengthen institutions for transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance Goals and Objectives of the NTP Foster macroeconomic stability and lay foundations for the diversification of the economy. Build critical transport infrastructure for sustainable development, including roads, ports, aviation, energy, public buildings, and broadband capability. Increase support to the social sector for human capital development and protect the vulnerable population, particularly persons with disabilities. Increase resilience to environmental and climate shocks. Mainstream gender equity, human rights, and inclusivity in all development policies and programs by empowering women, youth and People with Disability as drivers of growth and nation-building. 13 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Since it gained independence in 1960, Somalia developed nine National Development Plans (NDPs); of these, seven were developed prior to the collapse of the central government, while the remaining two were drafted after 2012 during the period of recovery and state building. The lessons learned from these previous NDPs revealed that the anticipated level of development was not achieved. In a country like Somalia that is recovering from decades of civil and political unrest, a complete paradigm shift leading to huge transformation in all sectors is deemed necessary. The important progress made under NDP-9 highlighted the need for a comprehensive transformation across all sectors to address persistent challenges and unlock the country’s full potential. In response, the government recognised the urgency of shifting from the traditional development-oriented framework to a National Transformation Plan (NTP). This strategic shift aims to accelerate the development of Somalia’s socioeconomic sectors by implementing targeted, high-impact key Interventions. The NTP is designed to drive real and tangible growth across all sectors, fostering economic stability, enhancing social services, and improving the overall quality of life for the Somali people. Transition from NDP to NTP Approach and Methodology Approach The formulation of the National Transformation Plan (NTP) incorporated an inclusive and participatory process by engaging stakeholders across the country. This approach integrates diverse perspectives, fosters ownership, and aligns with national priorities by incorporating both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Communication played a central role, with a dedicated team utilising platforms like TV, radio, and social media to maximise public awareness and participation. Stakeholder consultations targeted a wide range of groups, including government entities, the private sector, civil society, international partners, academia, and the diaspora. The process focused on sectoral discussions at federal and state levels. Consultations conducted gathered inputs on priorities and challenges to establish the foundations of the NTP formulation. Methodology The NTP development process utilised a mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a holistic understanding of Somalia’s key economic, social, governance, and environmental challenges and sectoral priorities. The methodology comprised four phases: the Pre-Lab, Lab, and Post-Lab stages, and FMS consultations. Pre-Lab Phase The Pre-Lab phase involved desk reviews and stakeholder engagements, examining existing data from baseline documents, institutional strategic plans, prior national development plans, sector-specific reports, assessments, and statistical reports. Numerous stakeholders, including ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs); the private sector; civil society organisations; the UN; and development partners, participated in the Pre-Lab phase. Federal Member State (FMS) Consultations The Ministry of Planning, Investment, and Economic Development (MoPIED) held consultations with the Federal Member States (FMS) between July to December 2024 to identify key states’ opportunities, challenges, and priorities. These consultations provided an opportunity to align states’ priorities with the National Transformation Plan’s sectoral priorities. The NTP technical teams facilitated inclusive discussions and active engagement, allowing participants to articulate challenges, propose solutions, and align their priorities with national objectives. Key stakeholders involved in the consultation process included representatives from FMS ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs); civil society organisations; academia; district-level representatives; and private sector actors. 4 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Transformational governance is the foundational base for a peaceful, democratic, and stable Somalia, and it encompasses inclusive politics, security, rule of law, and public sector reform. Key Pillar Findings Transformational Governance The adoption of the 2012 Provisional Constitution introduced federalism as Somalia's governance model, establishing a framework for decentralisation, state-building, and the formation of Federal Member States (FMSs). This marked a significant step toward implementing a federal governance system. To build a robust and inclusive federal structure, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) has undertaken key reforms to deepen and strengthen federal institutions. These efforts include unbundling government functions, finalising the constitution, establishing local governance structures by recognising the role of the third tier of government, and enhancing intergovernmental relations (IGR), among other initiatives. As part of these reforms, the FGS has made significant progress in reviewing and finalising the Provisional Constitution. In March 2024, Parliament approved amendments to the first four chapters of the Provisional Constitution, marking a major milestone in Somalia’s constitutional reform process. The review emphasises national dialogue, inclusivity, and consensus-building, with the goal of finalising the Constitution by 2026. Electoral reforms and inclusive governance are key priorities in Somalia’s transition toward democratisation and good governance. Plans are underway to move from the current 4.5 clan-based power-sharing model to a universal suffrage system by 2026. In November 2024, Parliament approved bills on elections, Political Parties Act, Electoral System Act and the National Independent Electoral and Boundaries Inclusive Politics Lab Phase The Lab Phase encompassed sectoral labs across the four pillars, including economics, social development, governance, and climate resilience. These labs facilitated collaboration among stakeholders, leveraging local insights for national planning. The facilitators also included public forums and discussions to ensure inclusivity and alignment with diverse needs. The expected outcomes include identifying solutions to gaps, formulating strategic directions for each pillar, and developing bankable projects aligned with NTP priorities. Post-Lab Phase At the conclusion of the Lab phase, all outcomes and deliberation from the lab reports were synthesised into a detailed and actionable transformation plan document with a comprehensive cost implementation strategy and a robust monitoring framework. Final Validation Validation sessions involving relevant stakeholders have been conducted to validate the NTP document, enhance ownership, gather feedback, and prepare for its implementation. The adoption of the Revised National Security Architecture (NSArch) was a major step taken in strengthening the security architecture of Somalia. The National Consultative Council (NCC) revised and approved the National Security Architecture (NSArch) in March 2023. This framework aligns the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and Federal Member States (FMS) on security goals, including the realisation of full integration of Somali Security Forces (SSF) and unified command structures. The NSArch envisages equitable security participation across FMS, fostering collaboration between federal and state security entities. Somali Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP), launched in December 2023, serves as an overarching national document to operationalise the NSArch objective by identifying capability gaps and charting implementation framework for achieving the vision for sustainable security sector. Under the fold of these national documents exist layers of mutually reinforcing policies and strategies, including the multi-faceted national counter-terrorism strategy with its six pillars aimed at addressing the existential threat posed by terrorist groups. The national threat assessment serves as a Security Commission Additionally, efforts are ongoing to increase women's representation in Parliament from 12.33% to 30% by 2026 through temporary special measures and engagement with political parties. There is also strong advocacy for the inclusion of marginalised groups, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) and persons with disabilities, in political processes. On the diplomatic front, Somalia has made significant progress in strengthening its regional and international engagements in pursuit of its national interests. Somalia is a member of several key international and regional organisations, including the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), the Arab League, and the East African Community (EAC). These memberships provide Somalia with valuable opportunities to expand its political, economic, and social influence on the global stage. 5 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Public sector reform refers to the deliberate efforts to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, and responsiveness of government institutions and processes. These reforms aim to enhance public service delivery, promote good governance, and foster economic development by aligning government functions with the needs of citizens and the broader socio-economic environment. Public sector reform focuses on the following areas: Public Sector Reforms At this critical juncture in its recovery from decades of conflict and political instability, Somalia's national development priorities heavily rely on the justice sector. The ongoing reform efforts have been guided by the need to build institutions that enable access to justice, promote the rule of law, and address long-standing grievances. By strengthening the capacity of rule of law institutions and building a more consistent culture of accountability, Somalia aims to break cycles of lawlessness while restoring public confidence in its justice system. Institutional integrity is essential for reducing impunity and promoting accountability. All rule of law institutions must be independent, free from corruption, and empowered to enforce the law with transparency. This effort will help restore societal trust in the justice system and foster an environment where fairness and accountability can thrive. The key priorities of the Rule of Law emphasise expanding access to justice, restoring and strengthening the core functions of rule of law institutions, and strengthening accountability mechanisms. Human Rights: Somalia's human rights landscape is marked by severe legal and institutional gaps, particularly in addressing gender-based violence (GBV), child exploitation, and limited access to justice. To address these challenges, the government of Somalia ratified international conventions and treaties promoting and protecting human rights. The enablers identified include capacity-building, legislative reform, raising public awareness, efficient resource allocation, strategic partnerships, and the implementation of robust monitoring and evaluation systems. Rule of Law mirror guide to existing threats, prioritization and recommendations on addressing them. Strengthening monitoring and control of transnational crimes and contributing to the effectiveness of the UN Security Council Resolutions governing this is crucial. This will be achieved through the mandate of the Central Monitoring Department (CMD) in research, monitoring and control, especially in readiness for transitioning UN Panel of Experts to Somali-led mechanism. Maximum efforts will be expended to gradually transition to Somali-led security and to realise the end-state of SSF assuming full responsibility for Somalia’s security at the end of the mandate of the new AU Mission (African Union Support and Stabilization Mission—AUSSOM). Through joint Concept of Operations (CONOPs) with SSF, AUSSOM is designed to support the implementation of SSDP and CT-Strategy through capability development and joint operations with SSF. However, the development and implementation of key security policies and plans still require external assistance and mentoring. Over time, it will be essential that Somalis themselves can ensure public order and security on land, air and at sea. Reforming civil service management is crucial for profes- sionalising the workforce and establishing a merit-based civil service capable of delivering efficient and equitable services. According to the World Government Effective- ness Index, which measures perceptions of public service quality, the civil service's independence from political influence, the effectiveness of policy formulation and implementation, and the government's commitment to these policies, Somalia ranks among the lowest, with an index score of -2.03. This score places Somalia signifi- cantly behind both the East African region and global benchmarks. Improving Public Service & Civil Servant Management A. As Somalia continues to build its public sector infrastructure, e-governance presents an opportunity to modernise and streamline government processes. In many African countries, such as Rwanda and Kenya, digital platforms for service delivery have greatly enhanced efficiency and accessibility, particularly for remote and underserved populations. However, Somalia's limited digital infrastructure and low internet penetration challenge the widespread adoption of e-governance. Strengthening governance structures and fostering a culture of transparency lies at the heart of efforts to restore institutional integrity. However, institutional fragili- ty, weak enforcement mechanisms, and systemic corrup- tion undermine progress. Many public institutions cannot implement and sustain necessary reforms, with legal frameworks often outdated and insufficient to combat contemporary governance issues. Moreover, limited collaboration among integrity institutions and inadequate whistle-blower protections perpetuates a culture of impunity and erodes public trust. Corruption in Somalia is a significant challenge, evidenced by its ranking on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). In 2023, Somalia scored 11 out of 100 on the CPI, making it the most corrupt country out of 180 countries assessed. This low score indicates severe issues with public sector corrup- tion, including impunity for corrupt officials and restricted access to justice. Institutional Integrity and Accountability: B. C. Digital Transformation E-governance offers a transformative opportunity to improve service delivery in Somalia. However, Somalia's current digital landscape is in the early stages of develop- ment, characterised by nascent digital infrastructure, limited e-government services, and a fragmented approach to digital transformation. The country ranks low on the United Nations E-Government Development Index (EGDI), which measures the effectiveness of a nation’s online services, telecommunication infrastructure, and human capital. The EGDI framework highlights the dispari- ties in digital readiness and service delivery, reflecting the need for a cohesive strategy that addresses the underly- ing gaps in Somalia's digital journey. D. Government Communication 6 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Sustainable Economic Transformation According to recent estimates, the Somalia economy will expand at an upward real GDP growth rate of 3.7% in 2024, divergent to a moderate real GDP growth rate of 2.8% in 2023. Despite the positive momentum of economic performance, the key major challenges facing Somalia’s economic growth include limited domestic revenue generation (e.g., a less than 3% tax-to- GDP ratio), an undiversified economy that is 60% dependent on livestock and agricultural crops, and climate change impact. There is high unemployment—particularly among youth (30.4%) and devastating food insecurity challenges, which has resulted in a poverty rate of 54.4%1 among the Somali population. The Sustainable Economic Transformation comprises the following sectors: Infrastructure and logistics sectors are also an essential component of Somalia's economic transition. As the nation emerges from conflict, immediate attention and investment are needed for the infrastructure sector. According to the recent assessments, the state of the Somali roads’ networks is dilapidated and mostly inaccessible due to insecurity. Of the 21,933 km of road network, only 2,860 km are paved roads, accounting for 13% of the total. Additionally, the energy costs in Somalia are among the highest in the world, where the electricity price is an average of $0.9 per kWh with 61.9% of the population accessing electricity. The infrastructure sector includes transport (roads, ports, airports), energy (electricity, hydro and renewable energy), and connectivity (broadband and mobile). To address these challenges, here are some key strategic objectives the government plans to implement by 2029: Strategic Objective: Enhance road transport networks to an efficient level of paved road connectivity from 13% to 18% by 2029 by investing in primary and secondary roads across the regions. Through coordinated efforts of strategic interventions, the Ministry of Public Works, Reconstruction, and Housing plans to rehabilitate existing roads and construct new roads. This will reduce transit times between major cities from days to less than 12 hours, thereby enhancing connectivity and economic integration. This initiative aims to rehabilitate 3,825 kilometres of key tarmac roads, renovate bridges, and establish drainage systems to mitigate flooding risks. These upgrades will halve transport times for goods and increase average B. Infrastructure and Logistics Sectors: Key strategic initiatives include upgrading existing airports by building modern terminals and runways, improving air control equipment and systems by strengthening modern safety systems, investing in international airports through public-private partnerships, and institutionalising airport operations through enhancing regulatory frameworks and standards Aviation Improve domestic internet access from 9.8% to 15% through investing in ICT infrastructure—mainly mobile networks, broadband coverage, and energy access. ICT Strategic Objective 1: Increase electricity access from 61.9% to 80% of Somalia’s population by investing in alternative sources of energy mix to expand electrification of rural areas by 2029. This is aimed at increasing the number of households with access to electricity, where the government is aimed at increasing energy supply for hard-to-reach areas and underserved populations in urban cities, including internally displaced locations outside in major capitals. Energy speeds from 30 km/h to 60 km/h, unlocking opportunities for agriculture, trade, and tourism. By 2029, this initiative aims to complete the rehabilitation of 3,825 km of planned roads. This would lead to the reduction of road fatalities to < 10 per 100,000 people and reduce transit time for commercial vehicles. Implementation for this project will begin in January 2026 and end in December 2029 Despite the limited market regulatory frameworks and lack of formalisation caused by the collapse of the Somali central government, the private sector continues to show promising growth and significant employment creation. The private sector primarily takes the lead in providing essential social and business services, including telecom- munication, financial, transport, and construction services. The key sub-sectors include trade and commerce, industries, manufacturing, telecommunica- tion, and financial services particularly advancing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Private Sector Development C. Somalia’s recent economic development shows positive momentum toward the nation's growth trajectory. The country has made significant strides in reducing the country’s public debt through the implementation of robust monetary and fiscal reforms as well as enhanced macroeconomic stability. The key focus areas include revenue mobilisation, expenditure management, debt management, monetary and structural reforms, and overall macroeconomic indicators, including inflation management, reducing unemployment, and external sector reforms. Macroeconomic Stability: D. A. Productive Sector: The productive sector is the backbone of Somalia’s economy and contributes over 70% of the GDP, with over 80% of external earnings, and significantly contributes to job creation. The productive sector is classified into agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, fishing and extractive sectors. 7 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 A. Education and human capital transformation is the source of the country’s human capital and targets to improve access to: Enhance equity of education by improving the enrolment of women, girls, persons with disabilities, minorities and marginalised groups to 30% with a gender parity index of 1 by increasing girl’s enrolment and retention and mobile schools integrating learners with disabilities by providing 65,978 assistive devices. To enhance the quality of education by increasing the Form 4 (Grade 12) mean score to 80%: Education and Human Capital: B. Health Care Services: Accessible and quality healthcare services are crucial to the country’s sustainable development, economic growth, social stability, and overall well-being with a target of improving maternal, neonatal, and child health. This will be achieved through expanded skilled birth attendants, enhanced emergency obstetric care, and strengthened immunisation programs by refurbishing 18 hospitals and constructing 7 state referral hospitals. However, the health sector is burdened by high maternal, neonatal, and child mortality rates, an acute shortage of qualified health workers, and limited facilities, with only 27% (Ministry of Health Report) of the population accessing health care. C . Water Resource Management: Access to affordable, quality water is critical for the survival of any nation. Water resource management is constrained by a scarcity of reliable water sources, with only 500 out of 8,305 deemed functional, coupled with seasonal variability, high water costs, and inadequate infrastructure for storage and distribution. By rehabilitating 2,000 water sources, promoting solar-powered water systems, and improving irrigation networks, access to water will be enhanced to provide sustainable, equitable, and secure water for national unity, growth, and well-being for all and in harmony with nature. The Social and Human Capital Transformation pillar is the key to empowering Somalia’s population by improving their well-being, opportunities, and capabilities for all regions and demographics through inclusive initiatives aimed at enhancing their quality of life with a vibrant service delivery structure. The government is committed to upholding human rights, ensuring equitable distribution of available resources, reducing poverty and illiteracy, and improving livelihoods. Components of Social and Human Capital Transformation The pillar prioritises access to education, healthcare, water & sanitation, durable solutions, social protection, women and youth empowerment, human rights, persons with disabilities, housing, religion, culture, and heritage. Social and Human Capital Transformation Basic education opportunities from 35% to 75% GER by building 5,327 schools, rehabilitating 426 schools, building 1065 labs, and digitising education. Increase technical vocational education and training (TVET) and higher education enrolment by 86% GER by building 3 new Somali National University campuses, rehabilitating Somali National University (Mogadishu), and equipping 12 new TVET centres. In addition, the government will tailor TVET courses to better align with women’s needs and broader job market opportunities as well as putting in place targeted strategies to improve women’s access to vocational education and employment. Increase the literacy rate from 53.7% to 75% by enrolling 770,600 learners in adult education and vocational classes. Provide pre-service, in-service, and Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) training to 50,220, 34,875, and 8,180 teachers, respectively. Develop, review, and implement curricula across all education sectors. Establish the Somali National Examination Board, Teachers’ Service Commission, National Qualifications Framework, and Somali National Curriculum Institute. During the NTP stakeholder lab sessions, particularly in the private sector engagement discussions, the Lab identified 203 proposed bankable projects. Among these, 81 were deemed significant, finalised, and agreed upon. These projects are projected to contribute an additional USD 5.7 billion to Somalia’s GDP by 2029, beyond the country’s business-as-usual growth trajectory. New investments in the productive sectors are estimated at USD 14.5 billion, with USD 6.2 billion expected to come from private investment. This marks the first step in transitioning from the National Development Plan (NDP) to the National Transformation Program (NTP), shifting the focus toward a producer-driven economy to acceler- ate rapid transformation. Projects: E. 8 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 E. The monetary poverty rate among Somalis is approximately 54.4%, with higher rates among nomads, internally displaced persons (IDPs), the disabled, women, children, and the elderly. This is further exacerbated by climate hazards such as drought, flood, etc leaving the most vulnerable population in the vicious cycle of poverty and exclusion. To address these challenges, the government will develop social protection schemes adapted to the needs of vulnerable populations and provide cash transfers, public work programs, and livelihood investment support for vulnerable households to increase resilience and set them on the path of prosperity and self-sufficiency. Social Protection: F. According to the National Disability Report of 2024 by the Somali National Bureau of Standards (SNBS), the overall prevalence of disability in the population aged 18 years and above is 11.7%, which highlights the importance of addressing disability as a development concern. The government aims to improve essential service accessibility, employment, and political participation Persons with Disabilities (PWDs): G. The Gender Inequality Index for Somalia is 0.776, placing Somalia at the fourth highest position globally. Somalia has extremely high maternal mortality (the highest in the world, at 692 per 100,000 live births), rape, female genital mutilation (FGM), and child marriage rates. The government aims to address this by promoting equal rights and opportunities for women in education, health, governance, and economic empowerment. Women Empowerment: I. Somalia's displacement crisis is a complex crisis with approximately 4.1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). These crises are driven by recurrent droughts, floods, conflict, and insecurity, resulting in substantial loss of livelihoods. Rapid urbanisation and rural migration have exacerbated the situation, forcing many Somalis to abandon their homes. To address this long-term investment need, the government launched the Pathways Action Plan to provide durable solutions for approximately one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) across diverse regions, with a projected budget of $2.09 billion, focusing on six priority areas such as government leadership, access to basic services, and access to employment and livelihood opportunities. Durable Solutions: B. J. The government of Somalia envisions Somali people living in peace and harmony guided by the principles of Islam as a religion of tolerance and peace. To that end, the government aims to preserve, develop, and guide all religious activities across the country through active promotion of religious awareness and fostering the Islamic cultural heritage. The government also envisions a Somalia in which every Somali is encouraged and supported to understand and follow the ethics of Islam to its correct teaching and to contribute to Somali society by upholding Islamic values and principles. Religious Affairs: B. K. The government considers culture and heritage, in all their forms, to be a fundamental component of cultural preservation and creating community cohesion. To preserve the culture and heritage, the government will rehabilitate the National Theatre for Mogadishu and establish seven new theatres in other states, establishing the Institute of Arts and Culture and expanding and renovating the Mogadishu National Museum and the National Library. Culture and Heritage: D . Water Resource Management: Adequate housing means adequate accommodation, security, and basic facilities such as water supply, sanitation, and waste management facilities with a target of housing about 30% coverage. Regarding sanitation, approximately 60.7% of the population in Somalia utilise improved toilet facilities. However, rapid urbanisation and displacement due to conflict, climate change, and migration to urban centres have increased the demand for decent housing. The government targets to build 410 apartment blocks, 1,000 villas, 2,000 low-cost housing units, and 20,000 shelters in major cities. It will also improve land zoning and develop sewerage and drainage systems in major cities. Somalia is widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change. The nation faces increasingly frequent and severe weather shocks, which have profound and far-reaching consequences on livelihoods, ecosystems, and economic growth. Perennial droughts, flooding, and recurring famines have not only claimed countless lives, both human and livestock, but have also caused widespread crop failure, further destabilising an already fragile economy heavily reliant on agriculture and pastoralism. These challenges have underscored the urgent need for action, prompting a nationwide focus on building environmental and Environment and Climate Resilience 9 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 A. Environmental sustainability is vital as it ensures the preservation and responsible use of resources, which is critical for Somalia's development and resilience. Somalia’s participation in international frameworks like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) highlights its alignment with global green growth agendas and its commitment to sustainable practices. This engagement is crucial for addressing the country’s environmental challenges, such as droughts, floods, and rising sea levels, which are intensified by climate change. By adopting environmentally sustainable policies, Somalia not only mitigates climate vulnerabilities but also accesses essential financial resources, technical expertise, and international support to build resilience and promote long-term growth Environmental Sustainability: B. Climate resilience is essential for Somalia's sustainable future, particularly in the context of climate adaptation, mitigation, and financing. By focusing on renewable energy development, Somalia can leverage its abundant solar and wind resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Expanding the renewable energy sector requires establishing robust regulatory frameworks, incentivising investments, and fostering public-private partnerships to overcome logistical challenges. Tax incentives for renewable projects and equitable access to energy resources will play a pivotal role in ensuring sustainable growth. Furthermore, financing mechanisms that integrate international support and innovative funding strategies will strengthen Somalia's ability to adapt to climate impacts. This transition not only promotes energy independence but also shields the economy from global energy market volatility, contributing to national energy security and enhanced resilience against climate shocks. Climate Resilience: C. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Somalia, where disasters are prevalent, necessitates the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing technologies, and automated water management systems. It is also essential to note that the development of holistic frameworks for DRR and risk identifications are paramount for better preparedness and response This integration enables precise mapping and monitoring of water resources, rainfall patterns, and drought conditions, thereby enabling proactive decision-making and guiding investments in water infrastructure and conservation. Automated systems, including early warning mechanisms, leverage real-time weather and hydrological data to predict and mitigate the impacts of droughts and floods. For example, these systems have facilitated the strategic deployment of water supplies to drought-affected areas, reducing humanitarian crises and enhancing community resilience. In Somalia’s arid and semi-arid climate, where recurrent droughts exacerbate water scarcity, disrupt agriculture, and threaten livestock survival, these advancements are critical. By improving disaster preparedness and response, DRR efforts not only mitigate the immediate impacts of natural disasters but also address long-term vulnerabilities such as food insecurity, waterborne diseases, and public health emergencies. Strengthening infrastructure to capture and store rainwater further bolsters Somalia’s capacity to withstand climate shocks and build resilience against future disasters. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR): Environmental sustainability Adaptation of climate-smart practices for agriculture, livestock and fishing Mitigation measures for deforestation, pollution and promoting renewable energy climate resilience. This resilience-building approach aims to restore ecosystems, enhance food security, and create sustainable livelihoods, ensuring that Somalia’s most affected populations can withstand future climate-related shocks. The key components under the environment and climate resilience are: BACKGROUND AND COUNTRY CONTEXT PART 1 11 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Introduction Country Profile Somalia, officially known as the Federal Republic of Somalia, is located on the Horn of Africa, bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Kenya to the southwest, Djibouti to the northwest, and the Indian Ocean to the east. The country covers an area of 637,657 square kilometres and has a population of approximately 16.2 million people. Somali and Arabic are the official languages of the country. Somalia's capital and largest city is Mogadishu. Before colonisation, Somalia was home to ancient civilisations that flourished in the region for centuries. Early Somali kingdoms such as the Sultanate of Mogadishu and the Sultanate of Adal were significant in trade and culture, engaging with merchants from Arabia, Persia, and India. The region was known for its strategic position along trade routes, facilitating cultural and economic exchanges. The Somali people are predominantly Sunni Muslim. Despite its rich cultural heritage and historical significance in the region, Somalia has faced significant challenges in modern times due to civil unrest and political instability. The country’s diverse geography features mountains in the north (Ogo Mountains), plateaus, deserts, and a long coastline stretching over 3,333 kilometres. The climate is predominantly arid to semi-arid, with coastal areas experiencing humid conditions and inland regions facing extreme temperatures. The country’s geographical position has both global strategic advantages. The coastal areas are key to trade, offering access to the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden, while the interior is characterised by dry, arid land with limited agricultural potential. The harsh terrain, especially in the northern, central, and some southern regions, has contributed to the country’s vulnerability to droughts, famines, and other natural disasters. There are two rivers flowing through the southern part of Somalia, contributing to agricultural production The State of Somalia Today Somalia stands at a pivotal moment, facing significant socio-economic challenges while also being presented with opportunities for growth and development. Decades of conflict, insecurity, and political instability have severely strained the country’s social and economic systems, leaving many citizens vulnerable. However, Somalia’s resilience is evident, with recent strides in governance reforms, economic recovery, and social rebuilding offering a hopeful outlook for the future. Widespread poverty remains a pressing concern, with over 54.4% of the population living below the poverty line. Unemployment, particularly among those 15-24 years of age, stands at a staggering 30.1%, depriving young Somalis of stable job opportunities and increasing their susceptibility to recruitment by extremist groups and involvement in illicit activities. While the informal sector provides a crucial lifeline, it lacks the structure and stability required for sustainable, long-term economic growth. Agriculture remains the backbone of Somalia’s economy, contributing 65% of the GDP and accounting for 75% of the country’s exports. However, the sector is highly susceptible to climate-related stocks such as droughts and floods, which have become more frequent and severe due to climate change. These environmental challenges contribute to food insecurity, displacement, and competition for scarce resources, exacerbating social tensions. The rapid urbanisation of cities like Mogadishu has placed immense pressure on essential services such as water, healthcare, and education, which continue to struggle in meeting the growing demand. Addressing these gaps is vital to enhancing the well-being of urban populations and ensuring social stability. Somalia’s social sector faces profound challenges, with only 35% of primary school-age children having access to education, particularly in rural areas. Healthcare infrastructure is also underdeveloped, with many regions lacking basic medical facilities, trained healthcare professionals, and access to essential medicines. High maternal and child mortality rates—among the highest globally—highlight the urgent need for improved healthcare delivery and access. Despite these challenges, Somalia has made notable progress in its path to recovery and growth. The government has introduced key economic reforms, including the modernisation of revenue collection systems and greater financial transparency, which have helped build trust among international donors and investors. Additionally, remittances from the Somali diaspora continue to be a crucial source of income, contributing approximately 21% of the country’s GDP and providing vital support to families and communities. Looking ahead, addressing high unemployment, improving access to education and healthcare, and enhancing resilience to climate change will be critical to unlocking Somalia’s full socio-economic potential. While challenges persist, the country’s resilience and ongoing reforms provide a strong foundation for long-term stability and inclusive growth. Somalia’s socio-political landscape is shaped by a complex history of conflict, governance challenges, and ongoing efforts to foster stability and inclusivity. Years of civil war and political fragmentation have left the country with weakened institutions, regional divisions, and persistent insecurity 12 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 However, recent initiatives to promote political reconciliation, strengthen federalism, and support democratic governance are significant steps toward a more stable and prosperous future. The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) operates within a complex federal system, where relations with Federal Member States (FMS) remain a challenge. Discussions on resource-sharing, power distribution, and security responsibilities continue to impact cooperation and coordination. Despite these challenges, progress has been made in fostering political dialogue and developing frameworks to resolve disputes. The ongoing constitutional review process is a crucial step in clarifying roles and responsibilities within the federal system, ultimately contributing to greater political stability. Somalia has also made progress in advancing democratic processes, with indirect elections for parliamentary and leadership positions becoming more institutionalized. However, the transition to universal suffrage remains a challenge, hindered by security concerns, logistical constraints, and limited voter registration systems Strengthening the electoral framework and ensuring inclusivi- ty—particularly for women and marginalized groups—are key to building a robust democratic culture. Insecurity continues to be a major obstacle to Somalia’s socio-political progress. Extremist groups such as Al-Shabaab persist in destabilising regions through asymmetric warfare, targeted attacks, and territorial control, particularly in southern Somalia. This ongoing threat weakens governance, erodes public trust, and disrupts essential services. Strengthening coordination between the Somali National Army, regional security forces, and international partners remains essential to counter these threats and ensure civilian protection. While challenges remain, Somalia has laid a strong foundation for stability through institutional strengthening, political dialogue, and international cooperation. Continued focus on federalism, electoral reform, inclusivity, and security sector reform will be vital to achieving long-term political progress and social cohesion. The path ahead is complex, but Somalia’s resilience and commitment to reform provide a promising outlook for a more stable, unified, and prosperous future. The National Transformation Plan (NTP I) 2025-2029 is not just a document; it is a bold roadmap that inspires hope and drives progress for Somalia's future. This plan marks the beginning of a transformative journey, laying the foundation for a prosperous, stable, and inclusive Somalia. At its core, the NTP I envisions a country with strong governance based on the rule of law, a thriving economy, and the capacity to deliver high-quality services to its citizens. Serving as a medium-term blueprint for an economically vibrant, socially inclusive, environmentally resilient, and democratically stable Somalia, the NTP I reflects a shared aspiration for a better and more prosperous future. It builds upon Somalia's commitment to sustainable development, guiding the country toward long-term growth. The NTP I aims to create a secure, prosperous, and inclusive nation, offering a high quality of life for all citizens. The plan focuses on peacebuilding, economic stabilisation, and sustainable development, with the follow- ing key objectives: Strengthen Institutions: 01 02 Establish transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance structures Infrastructure Development: Build essential infrastructure, including roads, energy, public buildings, and broadband capabilities, to support sustainable development. Economic Stability: Foster macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for diversifying the economy. 03 Human Capital: 04 05 Invest in the social sector to improve education, healthcare, and protection for all Somalis Gender Equity and Inclusivity: Integrate gender equity and inclusivity into all development policies, empowering women and youth as key drivers of growth. Climate Resilience: Enhance the country's resilience to environmental and climate-related challenges. 06 NTP alignment with Centennial Vision 2060 and Sustainable Development Goals 13 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 The development of the NTP I draws from lessons learned from past plans and strategies while also capitalising on existing opportunities for effective implementation. The process involved extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, including government ministries, federal member states, the private sector, civil society, international partners, and the Somali people. This inclusive approach ensures that the NTP I reflects the aspirations of all Somalis and marks a shift toward a Somali-owned, participatory development process. To ensure a comprehensive approach, the NTP I formulation included alignment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators and involved extensive group discussions, data collection, and consultations to establish strategic frameworks and define achievable milestones for key goals. Notably, the Big Fast Results© (BFR) 8-Steps Transformation Methodology was applied to guide discussions across seven priority areas through four phases of consultation, allowing for a systematic, results-oriented approach to shaping the NTP I's framework. This methodology was deployed to organise and guide these discussions, ensuring a systematic approach to finding actionable ideas and shaping outputs. The process employed four phases of consultations: FMS Engagement, Pre-Lab, Lab, and Post-Lab sessions involving detailed group discussions and comprehensive data collection tools to assess the current baseline and establish targeted and achievable milestones for key priority goals and objectives. Key findings from the consultation process emphasise the need for stronger institutions and regulatory frameworks to address challenges such as fostering an inclusive political culture, advancing the rule of law, improving security, and supporting socio-economic development. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive, durable strategy that includes strengthening governance, enhancing security, driving economic growth, and promoting national cohesion, while developing genuine resilience against climate shocks. Priority areas also include expanding healthcare services, particularly for maternal and child health, improving water resource management, and ensuring equitable access to education. The plan also focuses on improving urban planning, food security, and affordable housing, while providing targeted support to vulnerable populations through social protection programs. In conclusion, NTP I provides a clear institutional and regulatory framework to guide Somalia’s development, addressing immediate challenges while also setting the stage for long-term growth and stability. By incorporating the views and aspirations of the Somali people, the plan aims to build a democratic, inclusive, and equitable society, where every citizen has equal access to opportunities and services. This effort is a crucial step toward creating a transparent, accountable governance system that will drive Somalia’s socio-economic development for years to come.

Reflections on NDP-9: Lessons and Opportunities Learnings of NDP-9 Building on the lessons learned from previous National Development Plans, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) developed and implemented the Ninth National Development Plan (NDP-9; 2020–2024). As part of its participation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, Somalia prepared the NDP-9 to meet the requirements for an interim poverty reduction strategy paper, which enabled the country to apply for debt relief. The primary goal of the plan was to address Somalia’s development challenges while establishing a framework for sustainable growth and long-term prosperity. The NDP-9 is built around four strategic pillars: inclusive politics, security and rule of law, and economic and social development. To effectively monitor progress, the government conducted a Midterm Review of the NDP-9, covering the first two and a half years of the plan’s implementation between January 2020 to June 2022. This review aimed to assess progress against the established indicators, identify challenges that were hindering implementation, and explore opportunities to strengthen the delivery of the plan’s objectives. The Midterm Review Report (MTR) provided an evidence-based analysis of the accomplishments achieved during the first three years of the plan and offered recommendations for the final year of implementation (2023–2024). Pillar 1: Transformational Governance The Transformational Governance pillar aimed to promote stability and peace in Somalia by establishing an effective, decentralised, and democratic federal system, underpinned by an inclusive political process. Key accomplishments under this pillar include the development and adoption of several important policies and pieces of legislation. These include the National Local Government Capacity Development Policy, the National Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Policy, the National ID and Public Registration Act, as well as reviews of the National Reconciliation Framework, the National Parties Act, the NIEC Act, and the IBFC Act. Collectively, these initiatives represent significant progress toward achieving Somalia’s long-term goals of stability, good governance, and inclusive political development. Pillar 2: Security and Rule of Law The Security and Rule of Law pillar focuses on building a security sector that meets the expectations of Somali citizens, ensuring stability through secure and affordable access to justice, and fostering public trust in the judiciary system. Key achievements under this pillar include the recruitment and training of 15,000 soldiers and 7,000 police officers in the federal member states, along with an additional 2,500-3,000 police officers at the federal government level. The National Security Architecture (NSA) was successfully revised and signed into law, and the Anti-Terrorism Act was enacted to strengthen the country’s legal framework. Additionally, the Ministry of Justice led several reform initiatives, providing technical support for bill drafting across various government agencies and guiding the development of a new justice system model. Pillar 3: Sustainable Economic Development The Sustainable Economic Development pillar aims to address the challenges posed by climate change, promote sustainable growth, and create more employment opportunities. Key priorities under this pillar include increasing government involvement in enhancing market efficiency, investing in Somalia’s traditional economic sectors to foster sustainable production, employment, and food security, as well as supporting utilities and diversifying the economy. Significant achievements under this strategic pillar include the development of local skills, the creation of regulatory frameworks, and the strengthening of technical capacity at both federal and state ministries to better implement infrastructure projects. Notably, the Mogadishu-Afgoye and Mogadishu-Jowhar roads are nearing completion, improving connectivity between the capital and the riverine regions of Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle. Somalia’s trade sector has also seen growth, with exports increasing from $1.131 billion in 2019 to $1.339 billion in 2022. In addition, Somalia has joined the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and, in March 2024, was conditionally admitted into the East African Community (EAC), marking a significant step toward regional integration. This marks a progressive step towards enhancing economic inclusivity and recovery after a long period of instability. Several key factors may have contributed to this shift, and these include 114 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Pillar 4: Social and Human Capital Transformation The Social and Human Capital Transformation pillar plays a critical role in shaping Somalia’s comprehensive poverty reduction strategy while strengthening the resilience of its citizens against economic fluctuations, conflicts, and the challenges posed by environmental and climate change. Key government priorities under this pillar include improving access to healthcare, advancing education and training, expanding social protection measures, and enhancing disaster risk management, human rights, and protection. By providing sustainable social key Interventions, these efforts aim to enhance the well-being of the Somali people. Progress has been made in several areas, with improvements in social indicators such as expanded education and healthcare services, reduced maternal and child mortality, and increased humanitarian aid. However, challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to education and improving the quality of healthcare services, which continue to be key areas of focus for future development. 15 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 With the help of international donors, the government put in place effective programs and policies to deal with existing problems, such as inadequate infrastructure and building institutions to enhance basic social services, with a focus on helping the most vulnerable groups. 11 With the help of international donors, the government put in place effective programs and policies to deal with existing problems, such as inadequate infrastructure and building institutions to enhance basic social services, with a focus on helping the most vulnerable groups. 22 While there are frequent shocks coupled with climate change, resilience-oriented programs and interventions also have a significant correlation with community adaptation practices, which could further improve poverty levels. 33 Through the support of humanitarian organizations, the provision of emergency interventions such as food and medical aids and social safety assistance programs such as cash transfers has also contributed to the decline of poverty situations across the country. 44 While there is ongoing violence across some regions, the improvement of the security situation in southern and central Somalia has also resulted in access to basic services such as education and health, which may have a direct result of poverty reduction. Building Resilience: Addressing the Challenges of NDP-9 National development plans, by their very nature, encounter challenges. These hurdles, however, reveal opportunities for growth, improvement, and transformation. In the same vein, NDP-9, while ambitious, faced several obstacles: 16 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 11 challenged unified implementation efforts. This challenge presents an opportunity to strengthen collaboration, enhance communication channels, and ensure more cohesive and integrated actions moving forward. 24 delayed essential reforms and weakened governance structures. At the same time, security challenges impeded progress in judicial and institutional reforms. These challenges emphasise the need for continued political dialogue, peacebuilding efforts, and comprehensive reforms that will ultimately contribute to a more stable and inclusive governance system. 23 including frequent droughts, flooding and resource degradation, highlighted the urgent need for stronger mitigation strategies. While these challenges are daunting, they also create an opportunity to prioritise sustainable environmental management and develop innovative approaches to climate resilience. 32 sector slowed progress in critical areas such as poverty reduction and food security. This was exacerbated by insufficient investment in infrastructure and a heavy reliance on climate-vulnerable sectors like agriculture. These challenges offer an opportunity to diversify the economy, invest in climate-resilient industries, and improve the sector’s productivity. 45 such as fragmented decision-making processes, unclear key performance indicators (KPIs), and transparency issues, limited the plan’s effectiveness. These challenges provide an opportunity to strengthen institutional capacity, improve data management systems, and ensure greater accountability and transparency in future planning. 27 A lack of widespread awareness of NDP-9 among federal and state institutions hindered its effective implementation. Without broad-based engagement, fostering a sense of ownership and alignment proved challenging, leading to uneven commitment and investment in the plan’s success 46 The absence of well-integrated state-level strategic plans that align with national priorities created challenges in harmonising efforts. This misalignment led to inconsistencies in development approaches, making it difficult to address both national goals and the unique needs of individual Federal Member States (FMS), ultimately slowing cohesive and impactful progress. As we work toward realising the goals of NTP I in the coming years, it is essential to focus on the following key priorities. These will serve as a guiding framework to lead Somalia toward a more resilient, inclusive, and prosperous future: While the NDP-9 faced several obstacles, the lessons learned from these challenges will be critical building blocks in refining future strategies and ensuring that Somalia remains on the path toward Converting Setbacks to Solutions: NTP I 1 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 03 Stabilisation in Post-Liberated Areas It is essential to prioritise security, basic services, and social cohesion in areas recently liberated from conflict. These actions will help sustain peace, rebuild trust, and foster a sense of stability that is crucial for long-term development. Developing comprehensive climate policies and promoting sustainable resource management are critical to mitigate the risks posed by climate change and environmental degradation. These efforts will contribute to a more resilient Somalia that can better cope with environmental challenges. 01 Fostering a more diversified economy is key to long-term stability. Emphasising private sector investment, youth employment, and skills development will create more inclusive growth opportunities and build a robust economy capable of withstanding future shocks. 02 Implementing a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is essential to track progress, assess outcomes, and ensure accountability. This will help ensure that development initiatives are effectively managed and aligned with national priorities. 04 18 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Aligning new borrowing with key development priorities will maximise the impact of Somalia’s participation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This will support sustainable economic growth and improve the country’s long-term financial stability. Strengthening coordination and oversight mechanisms is key to ensuring smooth and effective implementation across all levels of government. Transparent processes are vital in building trust among stakeholders, promoting accountability, and ensuring that resources are used efficiently. Extensive consultations across regions ensured that the voices and needs of Somali citizens were effectively integrated into the plan. This inclusive approach lays the foundation for broad-based development, ensuring that all citizens have a stake in the country’s progress. Addressing capacity constraints and enhancing institutional efficiency, governance, and service delivery will be critical to supporting Somalia’s long-term development goals. Strengthening these institutions will ensure that the benefits of development are felt across all sectors and regions. Plans must be grounded in a clear understanding of available resources and institutional capacity. By setting achievable objectives and establishing clear pathways for implementation, Somalia can ensure that plans are both realistic and sustainable. Economic Growth, Increased Productivity and Investments 19 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Vision for Transformation:  “The Somalia We Want” Somalia stands at a pivotal moment in its development journey, driven by a collective vision for a peaceful, prosperous, and inclusive nation. Building on the achievements and lessons of NDP-9, NTP I sets a bold course for the next phase of Somalia’s transformation. NTP I is aligned with the country’s CV2060, with a commitment to deliver meaningful and measurable improvements across critical development sectors, ensuring that every Somali benefits from progress, no matter their location or circumstances. At the core of this vision is the goal of aligning national priorities with regional, continental, and global objectives. The NTP I is not only a strategic framework but a firm commitment to fostering resilience, promoting sustainability, and achieving shared prosperity. By prioritising collaborative governance, equitable resource distribution, and evidence-based decision-making, Somalia is determined to address persistent gaps in infrastructure, service delivery, and economic opportunities. The clear overarching objective is to lay the foundation for sustainable development, empowering individuals and communities while strengthening the nation’s ability to tackle complex global challenges. Looking ahead, this chapter outlines the key thematic areas that will guide Somalia’s transformation. Each area reflects the interconnected pillars of economic growth, stability, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability, together charting a course toward "The Somalia We Want.” This thematic area represents Somalia’s vision for an inclusive and diversified economy that creates opportunities for all its citizens. Building on its traditional strengths in agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, Somalia aims to modernise and expand these sectors to boost productivity and sustainability. Key investments in infrastructure—such as roads, ports, and energy systems—will unlock market potential, facilitating both domestic and regional trade. At the same time, Somalia is committed to fostering private sector growth by improving the business environment, removing regulatory barriers, and promoting financial inclusion. By prioritising high-growth sectors like tourism, renewable energy, and value-added manufacturing, the country seeks to reduce reliance on imports, create jobs, and promote more equitable wealth distribution. The ultimate goal is to build a resilient economy that not only meets the basic needs of its people but also positions Somalia as a competitive player in regional and global markets. A Peaceful, Democratic, and Stable Nation Achieving sustainable development is intrinsically linked to peace, security, and inclusive governance. This thematic area envisions a Somalia where citizens are free from conflict and empowered to actively engage in democratic processes. A strengthened federal system, supported by transparent governance structures, will ensure that decision-making reflects the needs and aspirations of all Somalis. This vision is one of unity, progress, and opportunity—where no Somali is left behind. We envision a Somalia where economic transformation empowers individuals, supports sustaina- ble growth, and ensures a pros- perous future for all Somalis. 20 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Improved Quality of Life and Jobs Creation A prosperous Somalia is one where all citizens can lead dignified lives, supported by equitable access to essential services and economic opportunities. This thematic area is focused on closing the gaps in education, healthcare, water, housing and social protection to address both the immediate and long-term needs of the population. Investing in public health infrastructure, along with innovative delivery mechanisms, will improve healthcare accessibility and outcomes, particularly for women, youth, and marginalised communities. Education reforms with skills development, with a focus on vocational and technical training to better align with labour market demands. The NTP also aims to create jobs by expanding value chains in agriculture, fisheries, and other productive sectors, helping to empower individuals and reduce dependency on humanitarian aid. Improved Quality of Life and Jobs Creation Somalia faces significant challenges due to its vulnerability to climate variability, including frequent droughts and flooding. This thematic area highlights the importance of a proactive approach to building resilience and mitigating climate risks. By adopting climate-smart agricultural practices, investing in renewable energy, and promoting sustainable water resource management, Somalia aims to safeguard its natural assets while strengthening community resilience.. Key initiatives include enhancing early warning systems and developing climate-resilient and liveable cities. Efforts to combat environmental degradation will focus on reforestation, soil conservation, and coastal protection, all of which are essential for safeguarding livelihoods. To ensure success, institutional frameworks will be strengthened, and local communities will be actively engaged in decision-making processes to ensure solutions are context-specific and widely supported. Additionally, international partnerships and access to climate finance will be crucial in scaling up these efforts and achieving long-term sustainability. Key priorities include establishing a justice system that is both accessible and equitable, alongside the implementation of policies that promote national reconciliation and foster community cohesion. Security sector reforms, including capacity-building for local law enforcement, will strengthen the rule of law and safeguard citizens' rights. By building trust between the government and its people and ensuring inclusive political representation, Somalia aims to create a solid foundation for lasting stability and a vibrant democracy. We envision a Somalia that empowers individuals, promotes social cohesion, and lays the ground- work for a peaceful and prosperous future for the nation. We envision a Somalia that not only adapts to environmental challenges but also leverages sustainable practices to drive long-term development, ensu- ring a resilient and prosperous future for all its citizens. We envision a Somalia where every citizen has the opportuni- ty to thrive, contributing to a more resilient and inclusive society. 21 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 NTP I Methodology and Process Pre-Lab Sessions: The Federal Government of Somalia employed the Big Fast Results approach for the formulation and development of the National Transformation Plan (NTP). This methodology serves as a dynamic and inclusive platform for problem-solving, bringing together diverse stakeholders to address specific challenges within a focused and collaborative setting. Unlike traditional planning methods previously used for the NDPs formulations, the BFR approach is characterised by its intensity, collaborative spirit, and ability to break down silos and bureaucratic barriers, fostering a culture of innovation and inclusivity of all stakeholders. Preparatory meetings to outline objectives, gather baseline data, and establish the framework for the Labs. Lab Sessions: Intensive, focused workshops where participants collaboratively identified challenges, proposed solutions, and set actionable goals and specific, measurable, attainable targets. Post-Lab Sessions: Follow-up discussions and evaluations to refine the outcomes, validate the findings, and establish clear, targeted milestones for key priority goals and objectives. Federal Member States (FMS) Consultation Engagement: Comprehensive discussions with FMS stakeholders to gather input and align priorities with local needs. At the core of the BFR, is its ability to facilitate inclusive planning and effective problem-solving. By convening a diverse group of participants—including subject matter experts, implementers, decision-makers, and community representatives—the method created a rich environment for generating innovative and practical solutions. This inclusiveness ensures that the voices and perspectives of all relevant stakeholders are heard and meaningfully integrated into the planning process. The BFR Methodology for developing the NTP involved four phases of consultations: NTP I Development Approach and Methodology 22 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 The NTP I is designed to create new job opportunities, boost sectoral contributions to GDP, and increase private sector participation in national development. For these objectives to be achieved, it is critical that they are communicated clearly and embraced by all stakeholders, ensuring a solid foundation for successful Set clear, realistic objectives that reflect national priorities. This collaborative and consultative approach ensures that the transformation process is both inclusive and practical, setting the stage for successful and sustainable outcomes. These Labs engage a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives from the public and private sectors, academic institutions, donor groups, and civil society organisations. The purpose of these Labs is to translate high-level national plans into actionable, detailed implementation programs, referred to as the ‘3-feet plan.’ During the Labs, participants work together to identify the responsible organisations, define the required resources, set budgets, establish timelines, and determine key performance indicators (KPIs). Through open discussions, stakeholders explore challenges, prioritise issues, and justify the need for change. They also propose solutions and review the outcomes of the labs on a weekly basis, ensuring that the process remains aligned with the overarching goals Comprehensive consultations are conducted throughout this phase, involving all key stakeholders, including federal and regional member states, Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), associations, and civil society groups. These consultations are designed to: . In the Labs, participants worked together to identify key ‘Initiatives’ and ‘Entry Point Projects’—two powerful tools designed to drive transformation Engage relevant stakeholders to gather input and foster collaboration. Promote interdepartmental coordination to ensure a unified approach. Leverage expert insights to inform decision-making and drive evidence-based policy. Establish effective feedback loops to ensure continuous improvement. Actively involve MDAs in the decision-making process for more inclusive governance. Implement performance evaluation mechanisms to strengthen policy development and enhance the effectiveness of implementation. 23 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiatives are bold, government-led programs or action plans, crafted to achieve specific socio-economic, environmental, or political objectives. These are typically broader and more comprehensive, especially within the social sectors, aiming to tackle systemic challenges and create lasting change. The ‘True North’ and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide a clear roadmap, setting specific targets that guide each sector’s path forward. Initiatives + To support these goals, various projects are identified through the Labs, each contributing to the broader vision. These projects are often led by the private sector in economic areas, or by development agencies in social sectors, ensuring that expertise and resources are brought together in the most effective way possible. This document highlights the deep connectedness and interplay between Initiatives, Entry Point Projects, and Enablers across sectors within Somalia, in achieving the holistic and sustainable development towards “The Somalia We Want” across the various thematic areas outlined. To simplify presentation, numerous chapters’ group these key interventions under umbrella terms such as Strategic Priority Projects, Strategic Supplementary Priority Projects, and Key Strategic Priorities. Meanwhile, the combination of forms a dynamic, action-driven framework—one that tackles immediate challenges while laying a strong foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success. On the other hand, Entry Point Projects are strategically selected key Interventions designed to address particular challenges within a sector, particularly in the economic space. These projects are intended to deliver quick, tangible results that generate momentum and excitement, setting the stage for larger, more ambitious initiatives down the road. Entry Point Projects + Complementing these transformative efforts are Enablers, which provide the foundational support required for the success of both Initiatives and Entry Point Projects. Enablers focus on cross-sectoral mechanisms such as Resource Mobilisation and Infrastructure, ensuring that the necessary financial, policy, and operational frameworks are in place to drive implementation and scale. While not directly delivering sector-specific outcomes, Enablers are critical to creating an environment where all other key interventions can thrive.

Transformational Governance O V E R A R C H I N G G O A L : 31 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Somalia is navigating a critical juncture in its journey toward stability and democracy, addressing legacies of decades of conflict, institutional fragility, and societal divisions. Building a stronger nation and society is a key part of the NTP. This is done to deal with problems that affect governance, security, justice, and social cohesion, and to lay the groundwork for a strong and welcoming state. Political stability remains at the heart of national transformation. A lot of progress has been made, like setting up state governments and passing four chapters of constitutional amendments. However, the Provisional Constitution is still not complete, as it doesn't address issues like judicial reforms, resource allocation, Mogadishu capital city status or the roles of different governments working together. These gaps undermine the country’s federal framework and electoral processes, which currently rely on a clan-based power-sharing system. Finalising the constitution and transitioning to universal suffrage are vital steps in creating an inclusive, transparent, and legitimate governance structure that reflects the aspirations of the people of Somalia. Strengthening local governance is equally critical for service delivery to citizens. Local governments often lack the institutional capacity, fiscal resources, and autonomy to deliver essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Reforms under this pillar focus on fiscal decentralisation, capacity building, and empowering local administrations to respond effectively to community needs, ensuring equitable service delivery, and restoring public trust in governance after decades of absence. Somalia’s national cohesion has been fractured by decades of conflict, inter-clan disputes, and marginalisation. Grassroots reconciliation efforts and transitional justice mechanisms, including truth, justice and reconciliation commissions, and reparations, are key to addressing A Peaceful, Democratic and Stable Nation Overview historical grievances and rebuilding relationships among communities. These initiatives aim to foster national unity, reduce inter-clan tensions, and cultivate a shared sense of identity and purpose. At the international level, diplomatic engagement and cooperation are essential for advancing Somalia’s development goals. Somalia continues to rely on financial and technical assistance while seeking to assert its sovereignty and leadership on the global stage. Strengthened bilateral and multilateral relationships, regional integration, and diaspora engagement will support national priorities and enhance Somalia’s global standing. Domestically, the justice system requires urgent reform to address its fragmented legal frameworks and limited access to formal courts beyond state capitals. Public trust in the judiciary remains low, exacerbated by inefficiencies and a lack of accountability. Reforms under this pillar prioritise harmonising legal frameworks, expanding access to justice, and modernising correctional facilities to focus on rehabilitation and alignment with international human rights standards. These efforts aim to ensure fairness, reduce recidivism, and enhance public safety. Fundamentally, security remains a critical enabler of all these efforts. Somalia continues to face persistent threats from violent extremism, weak border controls, and the proliferation of illicit arms. The security sector reforms outlined in this pillar aim to develop capabilities and professionalise defence and security sector institutions, implement counter-terrorism strategies, and transition security responsibility from international support missions to Somali Security Forces. By building a cohesive, accountable security apparatus, these efforts aim to safeguard Somalia’s sovereignty and ensure public safety. 32 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Somalia’s public sector faces significant challenges, including weak institutions, corruption, resource constraints, and fragmented governance structures. Low public trust, skill gaps, outdated systems, and limited digital integration further undermine its effectiveness. However, growing political will, prudent utilisation of scarce resources, technological advancements, and a focus on citizen-centred engagement present an opportunity for transformative change. The reform agenda, centred on three interconnected priorities, aims to address historical legacies and equip institutions to meet modern governance demands with accountability and transparency. Despite ongoing challenges, Somalia has shown progress in key areas, including constitutional reform, inter-clan dialogues, and strengthened international partnerships. However, these efforts must be sustained and scaled to address deeply entrenched issues. By addressing governance, justice, security, and social cohesion in tandem, the NTP I aims to restore trust in institutions, foster unity, and build a resilient state capable of meeting the aspirations of its people. Through these interconnected reforms, Somalia can achieve sustainable peace, stability, and democracy, laying the groundwork for a prosperous future Game Changers Across this pillar, there are ten key game-changing initiatives aimed at addressing Somalia’s most pressing challenges by establishing a robust constitutional and electoral framework, empowering local governance, fostering national unity, modernising the corrections system, countering extremism, and building a resilient and inclusive state that promotes stability, accountability, and democratic governance: 33 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 1 Somalia officially adopted the federal system in 2004 with the establishment of the Transitional Federal Charter, which laid the groundwork for a federal state structure as part of a larger peace and state-building process. This shift was further solidified in the 2012 Provisional Federal Constitution, which formally recognised Somalia as a Federal Republic, consisting of two tiers of government, namely, the Federal Government level and Federal Member States (FMS) level, which is comprised of the Federal Member State government and the local governments, under a framework of shared powers agreed upon by all levels of governance. The federal system was intended to address longstanding issues of clan-based conflict, improve governance, and promote local autonomy in a way that reflected Somalia's diverse communities. However, the implementation of federalism in Somalia has faced various challenges, including disputes over the delineation of boundaries, division of powers, and resource-sharing between the federal government and member states. The introduction of federalism and the formation of federal member states also presented opportunities for conflict management, economic development, increased efficiency, and enhanced political participation. However, significant challenges persist, including security issues, clan conflicts, and power-sharing disputes that continue to pose risks. The devolution of power is crucial for communities, as their distinct needs are often overlooked by a unitary government. The establishment of federal member states has empowered these regions to create their own governmental structures, enabling tailored approaches to governance and development. As a result, it allows local populations to gain a stronger voice and greater stake in their governance. 3 A fundamental aspect of a federal system is the establishment and effective implementation of clear functional and competency assignments across different levels of government. This clarity delineates responsibilities, fosters accountability, and ensures that government entities are held responsible for their specific roles. Effective implementation enhances service delivery, promotes transparency, and improves efficiency by minimising overlap among federal, state, and local governments. This allows for tailored services that meet the unique needs of local communities and ensures better resource allocation to areas in need. This will lay the groundwork for an inclusive, robust, and resilient federal system, promoting active citizen participation, strengthening institutional capacities, enhancing responsiveness to challenges, and fostering accountability which are key elements for a thriving democracy. 4 An effective intergovernmental relations (IGR) framework is crucial for enhancing policy coordination and implementation, thereby fostering a stable and resilient governance system that aligns with Somalia’s federal aspirations. This framework not only strengthens accountability but also builds trust among various levels of government and the communities they serve. By promoting collaboration and clear communication, the IGR framework can facilitate the seamless execution of policies, ensuring that they are responsive to the needs of the population and contribute to the overall development and stability of the nation. 2 Finalising Somalia’s Provisional Constitution is essential to establishing clear governance structures, resolving jurisdictional conflicts, and defining resource allocation and judicial independence. This initiative creates a unified framework for federal and state governments, laying the foundation for transparent and inclusive democratic governance. 34 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 11 Somalia has been faced with the existential threat of terrorism. In response to this extraordinary challenge, the government has developed a multi-faceted national counter-terrorism strategy comprising of six mutually reinforcing pillars: offensive operations to militarily interdict and degrade terrorist groups to rid them of territorial control; strengthening urban security to prevent and counter terrorist groups infiltration and attacks in state capitals and Mogadishu; instituting systems to strengthen counter-terrorist financing with the view of crippling terrorist groups finances and sources of revenue; enhancing strategic communication to amplify government successes and drown out terrorist groups’ narratives; prevention and countering of violent extremism ideologies to identify and address roots causes through appropriate soft-power initiatives. This initiative emphasises public awareness, youth engagement, adopting inclusivity to bridging inequalities, conflict resolution, economic development, and robust border security measures; rolling out tailored stabilisation programs in territories recovered from terrorist groups to afford the affected populations peace dividends to spur confidence and win hearts and minds. 6 Strengthening local government systems through fiscal decentralisation and institutional capacity building empowers administrations to deliver equitable services efficiently. Improved governance at the local level fosters public trust, accountability, and responsiveness to community needs. 7 Promoting national cohesion involves grassroots reconciliation efforts and inclusive dialogues to address historical grievances. Transitional justice mechanisms such as truth commissions and reparations aim to heal societal divisions, reduce inter-clan tensions, and enhance social harmony. 8 This can be achieved by enhancing diplomacy, diaspora inclusion, and regional integration to elevate Somalia’s regional and global alliances, participation in decision making processes, and secure international development goals. 10 Modernising the corrections system focuses on upgrading prisons infrastructure and implementing rehabilitation programmes aligned with international human rights standards. These reforms reduce recidivism, improve inmate treatment, and facilitate societal reintegration, enhancing public safety. 5 A refined electoral legal framework eliminates ambiguities and biases in election laws, ensuring equitable voter registration and fair representation. By promoting transparency and inclusivity, this initiative builds public trust and enhances the legitimacy of Somalia’s electoral processes. 35 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Chapter 1: Inclusive Politics 1.1. Overview O B J E C T I V E : Driving Inclusive Political Reforms and Resilience Following decades of conflict and institutional breakdown, Somalia has made significant strides toward strengthening governance structures. The passage of the 2012 Provisional Constitution marked a pivotal milestone, establishing a federal system and enabling the formation of Federal Member States (FMSs). These efforts laid the groundwork for federalism, creating a governance framework aimed at inclusivity and shared authority. Peaceful transfers of power have further solidified government continuity, underscoring Somalia’s commitment to political stability. However, challenges remain, particularly disagreements between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and FMSs regarding federalism, decentralisation, and the finalisation of the constitution. These unresolved issues impede Somalia’s ability to hold direct Political stability will address issues related to the establishment of an inclusive federal system through the finalisation of the constitution, the unbundling of functional assignments, the development of a comprehensive intergovernmental relations (IGR) framework, and the democratisation of Somalia governance through free and fair elections. elections under universal suffrage and fully realise democratic governance. The current FGS is tasked with addressing these challenges by completing the federalisation process, finalising the constitutional review, and preparing for democratic elections in 2026. Recent milestones, such as the approval of the first four chapters of constitutional amendments, highlight progress in advancing federalism and reaffirm the Somali government’s commitment to reform. Yet, persistent security concerns, limited intergovernmental collaboration, and the need for a cohesive electoral framework necessitate urgent action to strengthen governance mechanisms and promote inclusivity. Key priorities and roadblocks hindering tangible reform on federalism include: National cohesion will concentrate on political and social reconciliation key interventions aimed at addressing the root causes of conflicts. These causes include historical grievances, inadequate power-sharing arrangements, unresolved territorial clan disputes related to grazing and water access, high energy consumption, and water disposal issues resulting from urbanisation. Additionally, it will examine the increasing social deprivation faced by internally displaced persons and the impacts of climate change. The goal of these key interventions is to restore national cohesion and resolve political impasses Local government development will highlight the empowerment of the third tier of government by providing fiscal and administrative autonomy to ensure effective service delivery. Strengthening diplomacy and international cooperation plays an integral part in enhancing diplomacy, diaspora inclusion, and regional integration by boosting Somalia’s sovereignty, attracting technical assistance, and securing international development aid. Enhances women’s representation in politics and decision-making. UN SDGs Addressed: Enhances women’s representation in politics and decision-making. 36 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 1.2. Theory of Change Somalia’s journey toward inclusive politics is a foundational element of its broader governance and development framework. Following decades of conflict and institutional breakdown, the FGS has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to promote political stability, national cohesion, local government development, and strengthened international diplomacy. These strategic pillars underpin the overall reform agenda aimed at fostering a peaceful, democratic Somalia with robust global engagement. The fragmented political landscape in Somalia has been shaped by internal factionalism and prolonged conflicts, amplified by the absence of a cohesive central government. Furthermore, the lack of consensus on federalism and decentralisation has led to growing discontent and trust among various stakeholders. Despite progress, including the passage of the Provisional Constitution in 2012 and the formation of Federal Member States (FMS), challeng- es such as limited public participation, unresolved constitutional issues, and inadequate local governance persist. These challenges undermine trust in government institutions, hinder equitable resource distribution, and exacerbate social divisions. To achieve these overarching goals and ambitions, the NTP I outlines four strategic initiatives necessary to achieve a peaceful, democratic Somalia with strong global engagements. These include: Promoting Political Stability by establishing an inclusive and resilient federal system through constitu- tional review will resolve disputes over resource sharing, power allocation, and promoting governance. Enhancing Local Government Development through strengthening institutional capacity, formalising roles, and promoting administrative and fiscal decentralisa- tion will enable effective local governance that fosters citizen participation and delivers community-focused services. Achieving National Cohesion through grassroots reconciliation, inclusive dialogues, and restorative justice initiatives will address clan-based conflicts and elite factionalisation to foster trust and promote a shared national identity. Strengthening Diplomacy and International Coopera- tion by enhancing diplomacy, diaspora inclusion, and regional integration will elevate Somalia’s regional and global alliances, participation in decision making processes, and secure international development goals 1 3 2 4 37 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 By addressing these challenges and pursuing these reforms, the FGS aims to establish a more inclusive, representative political system capable of delivering equitable services across all localities. Attaining political stability aims to be achieved through a well-de- fined federal structure, equitable resource allocation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Local government development will lead to improved service delivery, greater public trust, and enhanced citizen participation in governance. These pillars will be aided by cultivating greater national cohesion efforts aimed at fostering reconciliation, reducing inter-clan tensions, and promot- ing social harmony. Strengthened diplomacy will position Somalia as a reliable partner in regional and global affairs, bolstering its international standing and economic prospects. The long-term impact of these reforms is a stable, democratic, and inclusive Somalia, where governance systems are transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of all citizens. A robust federal framework will provide the foundation for sustainable development, economic growth, and national unity. These reforms represent a comprehensive approach to addressing the country’s political and governance challenges. By focusing on political stability, local governance, national cohesion, and interna- tional cooperation, the NTP I charts a cohesive path towards achieving a democratic, inclusive, and peaceful Somalia. Somalia’s political landscape has been fragmented due to internal factionalism, prolonged conflicts, and the absence of a cohesive central government. The lack of consensus on federalism and decentralisation has intensified discontent and distrust among various constituencies. Despite progress, including the passage of the Provisional Constitution in 2012 and the formation of Federal Member States (FMS), several challenges persist: These challenges undermine trust in government institutions, hinder equitable resource distribution, and exacerbate social divisions throughout the country. In response to these challenges, the Federal Government of Soma- lia (FGS) has initiated an ambitious reform agenda aimed at achiev- ing political stability, national cohesion, and local government development. The strategic initiatives of this agenda are designed to foster: • Limited public participation in governance • Unresolved constitutional issues • Inadequate local governance structures • A peaceful, federal, and democratic Somalia • Stronger local governments with financial and • administrative autonomy for effective service delivery • National cohesion through reconciliation efforts • to address grievances and rebuild the social fabric. • Enhancing Somalia’s position on global and regional • stages 39 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Strategic Objective 1: Build an Inclusive and Resilient Federal System Initiative 1. Finalisation of Constitutional Review process of Somalia Key Interventions: While the 2012 Provisional Constitution laid the groundwork for a federal system, it lacked clarity in defining legal and institutional structures. Although it established three tiers of government—fed- eral, state, and district (the latter under state jurisdiction)—it did not specify the functions assigned to each level nor provide a frame- work for intergovernmental relations. The introduction of federal- ism and the formation of Federal Member States presented oppor- tunities for conflict management, economic development, increased efficiency, and enhanced political participation. Howev- er, significant challenges persist, including security issues, clan conflicts, and power-sharing disputes that continue to pose risks. The formal adoption of federalism in Somalia represented a pivotal step in regional autonomy and local governance. The devolution of power is crucial for communities as their distinct needs are often overlooked by a unitary government. To address these challenges and achieve the successful building of an inclusive federal system, the following initiatives are critical: The goal of the finalisation of the constitutional review process aims to move the country from Provisional constitu- tion to a permanent constitution accepted by the Somali people at large. The Final Constitution will serve as a corner- stone for ending Somalia's perpetual transition and clan-based political system, and for restoring stable constitutional gover- nance in Somalia. The review and finalisation of Somalia's provisional constitution are vital for achieving national consensus, peace, and political stability. This process, rooted in federalism, is a national priority and presents an opportunity for transformative progress in the country. Initiative 2. Strengthening Intergovernmental Relations The goal of the finalisation of the constitutional review process aims to move the country from Provisional constitu- tion to a permanent constitution accepted by the Somali people at large. The Final Constitution will serve as a corner- stone for ending Somalia's perpetual transition and clan-based political system, and for restoring stable constitutional gover- nance in Somalia. The review and finalisation of Somalia's provisional constitution are vital for achieving national consensus, peace, and political stability. This process, rooted in federalism, is a national priority and presents an opportunity for transformative progress in the country. Building consensus and political will in the constitutional review process Key Interventions: Develop Legislative and Policy Frameworks: through a clear framework for intergovernmental relations, enhancing collaboration and accountability among different government levels. Establishing effective institutions for better coordination and service delivery, resulting in enhanced citizen trust in government processes and improved public services Drafting constitutional amendments for politically contentious articles Coordinating and facilitating the constitutionalisation of key agreements Promoting inclusivity in the Constitutional Review Process with a special focus on marginalised groups Finalising technical amendments to the provisional constitution Coordinating and facilitating working sessions on constitutionalising the existing agreements of political contentious issues (core principles Submitting the Reviewed Constitution to the Federal Parliament Adoption of the Provisional Constitution by the Federal Parliament Public Outreach and Civic Education Initiatives Harmonisation of Federal Member State Constitutions with the New National Constitution Holding a public referendum for the approved constitution Implementation of the Adopted Constitution for Effective Governance Key Result Area 1: Political Stability Case for Change Somalia’s political landscape continues to exhibit fragility, charac- terised by an incomplete federalisation process, weak governance structures, and inadequate mechanisms to guarantee free and fair elections. Significant milestones have been achieved, including the recent finalisation of the first four chapters of the Provisional Constitution, agreements by the National Consultative Council (NCC) regarding the allocation of powers, fiscal federalism, securi- ty architecture, and justice model, as well as the successful adoption of the three electoral bills. However, challenges remain in effectively operationalising these frameworks and transferring the political agreement into legislative framework or constitutional provision to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and legitimacy in political processes. The fundamental key priority areas within the political stability initiative encompasses the process of change and its outcomes. The key areas under this initiative include federalism and elections. 1.3. Key Result Areas 40 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 3. Unbundling of Functions and Competency Assignment Key Interventions: Governance Effectiveness: Assigning functions based on capacity to a more efficient government structure Initiative 4: Fiscal Decentralisation Key Interventions: Local Revenue Generation: Increased local revenue generation will empower local governments financially; allowing them to address community needs more directly and effectively, potentially enhancing the quality of services provided. Initiative 1. Establish a Robust Electoral Legal Framework Key Interventions: Build on the Establishment Act of NIEBC, the Electoral Law, and the Political Parties Act of 2024. Finalise complementary regulations, bylaws, and implementation manuals to operationalise the legal framework Eliminate ambiguities in existing electoral laws to ensure clarity and consistency. Address potential biases that may favour incumbents or disadvantage opposition parties and independent candidates. Engage political parties, civil society, and citizens in the legislative refinement process to build confidence Ensure elections are perceived as legitimate, equitable, and representative of the electorate’s will Revenue Sharing Mechanisms: Establishing clear revenue-raising powers and equitable sharing mechanisms to promote fairness in resource distribution. Public Sector/Civil Service Reform and Capacity Building: Civil service rationalisation that leads to a more efficient and responsive government structure. Capacity Assessments: Conducting capacity assessments and implementing training to empower civil servants to improve performance and service quality. Preparedness and Guidelines: Clear guidelines and frameworks for function assignments, public institutions to fulfil their roles, potentially leading to improved public services. Alignment with the Constitution: Reviewing and development of sector policies to ensure that government actions are aligned with constitutional mandates, fostering better governance and citizen rights protection. Implementation of sector-specific laws that facilitate the effective operation of government functions to improve accountability and transparency in public service delivery. Key foundational laws, including the Electoral System Act, Estab- lishment Act of National Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (NIEBC) and the Political Parties Act, have been passed, yet critical gaps remain in finalising complementary regulations and addressing ambiguities that can disadvantage opposition parties or marginalised groups. Boundary delimitation, often a contentious issue globally, poses a specific risk in Somalia, where unresolved land disputes and security concerns can further marginalise vulnerable populations, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), women, and youth. Without equitable voter registration and polling access, trust in the electoral process risks further erosion. The National Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission (NIEBC), though pivotal, faces institutional weaknesses, including insufficient technical expertise, inadequate resources, and limited operational capacity. These deficiencies undermine its ability to oversee credible elections and voter registration, critical for transitioning to universal suffrage for the first time in five decades. Political representation remains skewed, with women, youth, and marginalised communities underrepresented in political parties and elected bodies. Without immediate and comprehensive reforms, Somalia risks perpetuating a clan-based power-sharing system, stalling democratic progress, and undermining national cohesion. By addressing these challenges through initiatives that strengthen electoral frameworks, ensure transparent and inclusive voter registration, build institutional capacity, and secure electoral environments, Somalia can establish a resilient foundation for political stability. These reforms will enable fair competition, promote trust among stakeholders, and reflect the diverse aspira- tions of its citizens, ensuring a sustainable transition to democratic governance. Strategic Objective 2: Hold free, fair and credible elections Somalia urgently needs to improve its ranking in the "State Legiti- macy Index," which assesses the representativeness and openness of government and its relationship with citizens. The goal is to raise Somalia’s State Legitimacy ranking from the current score of 9.6 to 8.1, a change that necessitates the conduct of free and fair elections at all three levels of government. 41 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 2.

Targeted Support and Advocacy: Conduct advocacy campaigns and provide financial support for female candidates to encourage broader participation. Promote Gender and Youth Inclusion: Implement policies to ensure gender and youth representation within political parties and elected bodies. Institutionalise Inclusivity: Build on previous achieve- ments to create a more inclusive electoral system that reflects the diversity and aspirations of Somalia’s citizens. Support Youth Leadership and Political Participation: It is the government's priority to equip youth with the right skills for good governance, participation, and leadership. The government is promoting civic engage- ment, support democratic and participatory gover- nance, meaningful youth participation through this NTP at all levels by providing them with skills training on conflict resolution, peace building, and social as a tool for the prevention of violence, building partnerships for peace, and promotion of youth reintegration at the community level. Build Public Confidence: Foster transparency and accountability to reduce disputes, enhance public trust, and ensure the legitimacy of election outcomes. 43 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 12. Increasing Participation and Representation for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) Key Interventions: Use strategies such as quotas and reserved seats.

Highlight current representation of women in Somalia’s federal and state parliaments and district councils. 44 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Key Result Area 2: Political Stability Case for Change Somalia’s local governance remains weak, with limited institutional capacity, unclear intergovernmental roles, and insufficient resourc- es. Local governments struggle to deliver essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, leading to public distrust and inequitable access for communities. This focus aims to address these challenges by strengthening institutional capacity, formalising intergovernmental responsibili- ties, and promoting fiscal decentralisation. Empowering local governments financially and administratively will enhance their ability to meet community needs efficiently and equitably. The expected outcomes include improved public service delivery, expanded access to basic services, and increased trust in local governance. By building accountable and responsive local systems, this initiative will position local governments as drivers of inclusive development and citizen engagement. The local government development key interventions aim to strengthen institutional capacity of the local governments, formal- ising intergovernmental responsibilities, and promoting fiscal and administrative decentralisation. Empowering local governments financially and administratively will enhance their ability to meet community needs efficiently and equitably. To closely monitor improvements in local government develop- ment Key Interventions, the NTP will utilise the "Public Service Delivery Indicator" which is currently ranked at 9.6, with the goal of improving it to 8 over the next five years. Initiative 1.

Wadajir Framework: A key approach to strengthening local governance in Somalia is the implementation of the Wadajir Framework, which provides a structured pathway for engaging local governance institutions before the establishment of formal district councils. The framework emphasises social reconciliation, participatory governance, and locally-driven decision-making as foundational steps before formal governance structures are put in place. In various districts, it has facilitated community-led social reconciliation initiatives, peace dividend investments, and capacity-building efforts to lay the groundwork for inclusive and accountable governance. By aligning with the Wadajir Framework, the NTP ensures that governance interventions are contextually responsive, particularly in areas where institutional foundations are still emerging. 46 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 8.

Strengthening Rule of Law and Trust: Enhance local security infrastructure to support the rule of law and foster greater citizen trust in governance. Facilitate Peer Learning and Technical Assistance: Support local governments with peer learning exchanges and technical assistance to bridge capacity gaps and improve responsive, inclusive governance. Key Result Area 3: National Cohesion Case for Change Somalia’s history of conflict and grievances has left deep societal divisions and weakened national unity. Persistent inter-clan disputes, marginalisation, and lack of trust among communities have hindered peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts, threatening long-term stability and development. This focus area emphasises on promoting national cohesion through grassroots reconciliation efforts and inclusive dialogues that engage diverse stakeholders, including marginalised groups. Transitional justice mechanisms such as truth commissions and reparations will address historical grievances, fostering restorative justice and rebuilding trust among communities. To ensure that viable transformation is being made in reconciling different constituencies of the nation, the national cohesion initiative utilises two indicators, namely, the “Group Grievance indicator” and the “Factionalised Elites Indicator”. The first indica- tor, “Group Grievance,” assesses societal divisions, especially Expand Birth Registration Coverage: Address the fragmented structure of the current CRVS system. Ensure integration with health and other essential sectors for better accessibility and effectiveness. Continue the implementation of the unified digital CRVS system launched in 19 districts in October 2024. Expand the coverage of the unified digital CRVS system across the entire country. Integrate CRVS with Essential Sectors: Launch and Expand Unified Digital CRVS System: Ensure every individual has legal rights and privileges through proper documentation. Use the CRVS system as a reliable source of health and demographic statistics. Promote effective governance and improved public services through accurate data. Support Reliable Documentation and Governance: 47 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 1. Peacebuilding and Reconciliation Key Interventions: Promote National Unity and Peacebuilding: Focus on grassroots reconciliation efforts and inclusive dialogues involving diverse stakeholders, including marginalised groups. Implement Transitional Justice Mechanisms: Use tools like truth commissions and reparations to address societal divisions and foster trust among communities. Promote peacebuilding through intercultural dialogue, cultural heritage and traditional conflict resolution, leveraging oral traditions, storytelling, music, and commu- nal rituals to foster dialogue, respect for diversity, mutual understanding, and national healing across diverse communities.

This measure includes ethnic, religious, and other group-based tensions, which could be exacerbated by unequal access to opportunities and systemic discrimination. Notably, it acknowledges historical grievances where communal groups feel aggrieved due to past injustices or conflicts. Somalia currently holds a rank of 8.7, surpassing the average regional target of 7.2. Hence, the national cohesion in the Group Grievance initiatives for the upcoming five years is projected to be the regional average score of 7.2. In parallel with political reforms, Somalia has made significant stride in stabilisation efforts, particularly in newly recovered areas. The government has prioritised the establishment of inclusive local administrations to ensure governance structures are representa- tive, transparent, and responsive to community needs. This includes laying the groundwork for essential governance functions, fostering national cohesion, and delivering key public services to strengthen the legitimacy of the state. The second indicator, “Factionalised Elites”, reflects the fragmenta- tion of state institutions along ethnic, clan, or other social lines and the rivalry among political elites. The score of 10 out of 10 for Somalia is a clear indication of extreme fragmentation, with political elites divided along clan and factional lines. This division often results in brinkmanship, gridlock, and political stalemate, where ruling factions prioritise their own interests over the country’s stability and development. The national cohesion in the Factionalised Elites initiatives for the upcoming five years is projected to be the regional average score of 8.7 A key pillar of these efforts is the rebuilding of the social contract between the government and communities. Ensuring inclusive decision-making, equitable service delivery, and responsive gover- nance, the government seeks to restore trust and enhance citizen engagement. These measures not only promote stability and local ownership but also create the conditions for long-term develop- ment and resilience in liberated territories. Strategic Objective: Fostering a peaceful, inclusive, and united society by addressing the root causes of conflict, promoting social harmony, and strength- ening resilience against divisions. 48 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 2.

Key Result Area 4: Strengthening Diplomacy and International Cooperation Case for Change Somalia is at a pivotal moment in its diplomatic and international engagement efforts. Somalia continues to recover from prolonged instability, fostering strong diplomatic ties and strategic global partnerships is crucial for sustainable development, peace, and economic growth. Enhancing Somalia’s diplomatic capabilities and international cooperation will not only increase its global influence but also attract foreign investment and reinforce its role as a trusted international partner. Somalia’s foreign policy faces significant challenges, including a low budget, limited institutional capacity within its diplomatic corps, a negative national image due to extended periods of conflict, and a fragmented diaspora community. Achieving a peaceful, stable Somalia requires strengthening both multilateral and bilateral relations, focusing on international cooperation, regional integration, engaging the diaspora, projecting a positive national image through soft power, cultural diplomacy and building the capacity of Somalia’s diplomatic corps. The prioritization of trade and expansion of regional integration should not come at the expense of addressing pressing internal issues and security concerns, which could otherwise undermine both Somalia and the East Africa region’s efforts toward regional integration and threaten stability of regional blocs in East Africa and the Horn region FIGURE 4: POLITICAL GLOBALIZATION INDEX RANKING OF EAC AND IGAD MEMBER COUNTRIES6 50 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 1. Bilateral and Multilateral Partnerships Key Interventions: Utilise memberships in key organisations such as the United Nations (UN), African Union (AU), Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), East African Community (EAC), and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to expand political, economic, security, and social influence. With these reforms, Somalia aims to elevate its Political Globaliza- tion Index to 60.3, aligning with the regional average. Key to this transformation is shifting from politically driven nominations to a professional, merit-based foreign service, empowering MOFAIC to prioritize skill-based appointments and train diplomats in positive image branding. Somalia's foreign relations strategy emphasizes its commitment to regional integration and international cooperation. As of January 2025, Somalia has joined the UN Security Council 2025-2026 term. As a full member of key regional organisations including the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the East African Community (EAC), and the Horn of Africa Initiative, Somalia has cemented its role in regional diplomacy and economic cooper- ation. Furthermore, Somalia has signed agreements to join the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which are currently awaiting parliamentary approval. It is important, under the NTP to ensure that commitments under these various arrangements are implemented timeously and with vigour which provides a strong signal to the private sector and international community. These regional partnerships are comple- mented by Somalia's participation in numerous multilateral organi- sations, including the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), and the Arab League. Somalia's membership in various regional organisations has been a cornerstone of its diplomatic strategy, recently reaching a signifi- cant milestone with its full membership in the East African Community (EAC). This step marks a new chapter in Somalia’s journey toward regional integration. As an EAC member, Somalia gains a valuable platform to harmonise trade policies, strengthen customs and border management, and deepen economic ties with neighbouring countries. To support this integration, Somalia has developed a comprehensive roadmap, appointing a Director Gener- al and a State-Minister within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to spearhead these efforts. Additionally, the country has begun adapt- ing the EAC Treaty to its national context and is working to finalise essential procedures and protocols for joining the customs union and common market by 2027. These strategic moves underscore Somalia's commitment to regional cooperation and economic alignment within East Africa. It is important to maintain a tight implementation schedule which should also serve as a catalyst for economic and business environment reforms. By cultivating close ties with IGAD and EAC members, Somalia can better protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity while address- ing mutual security and economic challenges. Engaging the diaspora in state-building and leveraging their advocacy abroad is equally critical to advancing Somalia’s interests globally. This comprehensive approach will position Somalia as a capable, credible, and respected player in the international arena, better equipped to pursue peace and development. initiatives for strengthening diplomacy and international cooperation. Membership in International and Regional Organisations: Engage in development initiatives through the UN and AU to benefit from support in areas such as security, human and political rights, and capacity building. Collaborate with other nations on shared challenges like conflict prevention, counter terrorism, smuggling, human trafficking and climate resilience. Participate in Development Initiatives Develop a policy to govern how institutions across the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) conduct relations with foreign partners. Provide guidance and frameworks for effective coordination of all support and developmental initiatives for Somalia. Operationalise clear structures and frameworks for all stakeholders to follow. Establish a Robust International Cooperation Policy Shift the UN office in Somalia from a political role to a development-focused mandate. Align the UN office’s role with Somalia’s progress in state-building and its evolving capacity for self-gover- nance. Adapt the UN’s presence to Somalia's strengthened institutions and consolidated peace, reducing the need for a politically focused presence. Transition UN Office Mandate: 51 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 3. Promote Diaspora Inclusiont Key Interventions: Promote cultural practices that maintain connections between the diaspora and Somalia. Encourage skill transfer programs to leverage the expertise of diaspora members. Strengthen Cultural Ties: Facilitate safe and efficient channels for remittances, which are estimated between 1.4 to 2 billion USD annually. Ensure remittances support food security, education, health, investments, and emergency needs for approximately 40% of Somali households Enhance Financial Remittance Channels: Encourage diaspora women and youth to seek employment in the civil service. Support their involvement in advisory positions with senior government officials. Empower them to shape key governance issues and contribute to a more peaceful, democratic, and stable Somalia. Promote Diaspora inclusion in Governance: Develop programmes that integrate diaspora contribu- tions into national development plans. Foster partnerships between diaspora communities and local governments. Expand Diaspora Integration Programs: Organise conferences, seminars, and workshops to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and expertise. Promote mentorship programs where experienced diaspora members can guide younger generations Facilitate Knowledge and Expertise Exchange Initiative 2. Regional Integration Key Interventions: Increased Market Access: By joining the EAC, Somalia will gain access to a larger market, with a combined population of nearly 300 million people. This can provide new opportunities for Somali businesses to expand and increase their sales by accessing a more extensive customer base. Collabo- rative efforts in sectors like agriculture, manufactur- ing, and tourism can drive Somalia’s economic growth and attract investment. Strengthen and build capacity for the Investment Promotion Office (SOMINVEST) and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to develop an enhanced work programme. This includes to operationalise the Special Economic Zones. Shared Resources and Knowledge: Member states can pool resources, expertise, and research efforts to tackle common challenges, such as healthcare, education, and sustainable development. Free Movement of People and Goods: Membership in the EAC would allow for the free movement of people, goods, and services across borders. Somali citizens would have the opportunity to travel, work, and study in other EAC countries, fostering regional integration and promoting cultural exchange. Regional Infrastructure Development: The EAC significantly emphasises developing regional infrastructure, such as transport networks, energy grids, and communication systems. Somalia could benefit from these infrastructure projects, contribut- ing to enhanced connectivity, trade facilitation, and regional economic integration. Increased Foreign Direct Investment: The EAC has a strong and growing economy, which can attract investment from both domestic and foreign investors. This can benefit businesses by accessing expanded capital sources, new technologies, and new markets. Overall, Somalia joining the EAC has the potential to create a more favourable business environment for the private sector by providing increased access to new markets, improved infrastructure, and a more favourable business climate. By leveraging these benefits, the private sector in Somalia can grow and succeed, helping to drive economic growth and development. Somalia will also capitalize on its participation in regional initiatives, such as the Horn of Africa Initiative, which prioritizes regional coordina- tion and cooperation for infrastructure connectivity, including transport corridors, power interconnections and single digital market. Collaboration on Security and Stability: As an EAC member, Somalia would have the opportunity to collaborate with other member states to address common security challenges, such as terrorism, piracy, and cross-border crimes. This would enhance regional security and stability, benefiting Somalia's security situation. Approaches to FDI will also continue to look outward to deepening relations with countries in the GCC, China, Turkey and others who are seeing a growing investment footprint in Somalia. 52 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 4.

Focuses on national security, counterterrorism, and law enforcement reforms. 2.1. Overview The security sector is the foundation of Somalia’s efforts to build a peaceful, stable, and prosperous nation. Recognising the persistent threats from insurgent groups and violent extremist groups such as Al Shabaab, organised crime, and inter-clan conflicts, Somalia’s security strategy has adopted a comprehensive approach aimed at tackling these complex challenges. These efforts are embedded in the National Security Architecture (NSArch) and the Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP), which form the strategic framework guiding the country’s security reforms. This approach balances immediate operational needs with long-term institutional development, aiming to create a resilient security apparatus that aligns with Somalia’s broader state-building goals is the phased approach laid out in the SSDP, addressing the ‘Now,’ ‘Next,’ and ‘Later’ stages of security development. The ‘Now’ phase focuses on generating and equipping sufficient forces to conduct offensive operations and hold territory, while also prioritising governance reforms, including the enactment of critical legislation such as the Somali Police Force Act and Defence Act. 55 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Somalia’s security reforms are not limited to developing military capabilities. These efforts extend to all rule of law and related institu- tions such as the Somali Police Force (SPF) to take on stabilisation roles in newly liberated areas and adopting community policing models. Investments in infrastructure, such as police stations and training facilities, alongside digital innovations for case manage- ment and accountability are integral to creating a responsive and trusted police force. The security sector focuses on addressing systemic vulnerabilities and fostering a unified framework for national stability. These efforts, supported by targeted investments and international cooperation, are transforming the security landscape, creating a stable foundation for Somalia’s future development. As a core element of the NTP I of 2025-2029, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) is embarking on an ambitious initiative to build a robust, accountable, and sustainable security sector aimed at ensuring long-term peace and stability. The NTP I aims to address systemic and structural challenges including weak institutional frameworks, limited resources and inade- quate capacities, and persistent threats to national security from violent extremist groups (including Al Shabaab). On the Global Terrorist Index, Somalia has the highest score among the eastern and Central Africa region. Against that background; it has also set a target to reduce its Global Terrorist Index score from 7.81 to 4.5 by 2029. Achieving this milestone will require to tackle terrorist activities, capacitate Somali security forces and implement comprehensive counter terrorism strategy. 2.2. Theory of Change FIGURE 6: HOUSE CHART: KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR DEFENSE AND SECURITY SECTOR7 56 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 With its setting of the True North for the security sector, NTP lights the way for legislations, policies and strategies with a comprehen- sive approach as its hallmark and that align with each other across the board. In this regard, the SSDP as informed by NSArch, takes a phased approach in developing and reforming security institutions to attain sustainable capabilities. Somalia’s vision is to establish a security system capable of safeguarding its citizens while adhering to principles of good governance and international standards, addressing decades of conflict and underdevelopment. To achieve this vision, SSF and its respective Defence and Internal Security line ministries will focus on five strategic priorities, each addressing a critical aspect of Somalia’s security landscape: With the above in place, an improved security environment, marked by reduced terrorism and conflict, will enable Somalia to achieve both social and economic progress. Strengthened governance, characterised by effective accountability mechanisms and transparency in resource allocation, will enhance public trust in both the government and security forces. Professional security forces, equipped with the necessary training and resources, will be capable of independently addressing internal and external threats. Financial sustainability, achieved through reduced donor depen- dency and efficient resource mobilisation, will ensure the longevity and sustainability of these reforms However, these initiatives hinge on key assumptions, namely the availability of commitment from the political leadership of the day which is essential to implementing security sector reforms. Contin- ued support from international partners is critical for capacity building and financial assistance. Additionally, aligned financial planning and effective stakeholder coordination are required to address evolving security threats and operational demands. While these assumptions provide a foundation for the plan’s success, several risks must be considered: political instability, financial constraints, and resistance from extremist groups pose significant challenges. Mitigation strategies, including robust planning and adaptive measures, are integrated into the roadmap to address these risks. The NTP I recognises that transforming Somalia’s security sector is a complex but essential undertaking. It requires coordinated efforts from all stakeholders to address systemic gaps, build institutional capacities, and foster collaboration. 1. FIGURE 7: EASTERN AND CENTRAL AFRICA REGION8 National Security Architecture: Implementing the NSArch to establish a clear, federated security model. Strengthening the collaboration of federal and state level government on security roles and governance. 2. Security Sector Development Plan: Implementing the SSDP to building the four core capabilities of account- ability and oversight, management and command, equipment and infrastructure, and capacity building and training through phased approach ("Now," "Next," "Later") to address immediate, mid-term, and long-term security needs. 3.

Compliance with UNSC obligations and countering transnational crimes: Strengthening the Central Monitoring Department (CMD) to meet UNSC monitor- ing and reporting obligations, countering transition crimes, and implementing the national WAM strategy 57 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative highlights the need for federal and state govern- ments to create national security architecture that is inclusive and merit-based. It aims to ensure broad representation from all sectors of society while avoiding actions that may reinforce existing divisions. By focusing on fairness and inclusivity, this approach seeks to build a more cohesive and effective securi- ty sector. Initiative 1. Promoting Equitable Security Participation Key Interventions: Create a national security framework that is inclusive and merit-based Build a more cohesive and effective security sector Strengthening collaboration between and among the institu- tions at the federal and state levels is vital for effective securi- ty planning and operations. This initiative calls for reinforcing cooperative frameworks based on shared objectives and mutual respect for the distinct roles and responsibilities of both levels of government. Initiative 2. Enhancing Synergy between Federal and State Security Strategic Objective: Enhance intergovernmental agreements on security architecture Key Result Area 1: Implementation of the National Security Architecture Case for Change Somalia’s security landscape is characterised by fragmented governance structures, limited institutional capacity, and persistent threats from insurgent groups. While significant efforts have been made to strengthen the country’s security framework, achieving a fully coordinated and unified approach has been a challenge. Historically, lack of cohesive collaboration between the federal govern- ment and state-level governments and contentious pre-election process has hindered the development of an effective and unified security apparatus, leaving critical vulnerabilities in the country’s national defence and public safety posture. To address these challenges, the federal and state leadership have reached a political agreement on Somalia’s National Security Architecture. This agreement prioritises building Somalia’s security forces that are acceptable, able, affordable and accountable, through collaborated and coordinated efforts with key stakeholders. Comprehensive training programs will enhance operational readiness, while equipping and force generation initiatives will ensure that security forces are adequately resourced to meet evolving threats. This initiative aims to establish a professional and self-sufficient security framework capable of safeguarding national securi- ty and reducing reliance on external actors. Targeted capacity-building measures will address institutional weaknesses, fostering stronger collaboration between federal and state entities. By aligning force generation with Somalia’s long-term security needs, this initiative will not only enhance immediate response capabili- ties but also lay the foundation for sustainable stability. Ultimately, this effort seeks to rebuild public trust in state security institutions, creating a resilient and cohesive security architecture that supports peacebuilding and national transformation leading to prosperity. As a core element of the NTP I of 2025-2029, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) is embarking on an ambitious initiative to build a robust, accountable, and sustainable security sector aimed at ensuring long-term peace and stability. The NTP I aims to address systemic and structural challenges including weak institutional frameworks, limited resources and inade- quate capacities, and persistent threats to national security from violent extremist groups (including Al Shabaab). On the Global Terrorist Index, Somalia has the highest score among the eastern and Central Africa region. Against that background; it has also set a target to reduce its Global Terrorist Index score from 7.81 to 4.5 by 2029. Achieving this milestone will require to tackle terrorist activities, capacitate Somali security forces and implement comprehensive counter terrorism strategy. 2.3. Key Result Areas 58 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 To maintain legitimacy and order, the government must uphold both the letter and the spirit of the provisional constitu- tion. Optimising engagements with state and non-state stakeholders in strict compliance with the constitution and political agreements is critical to fostering trust and stability. Initiative 3. Enhancing Constitutional Adherence and Engagement with Stakeholders This initiative focuses on developing clear SSF rationalisation and integration policy and protocols, within the existing frame- work of the NSArch. A broader post-Violent Extremism securi- ty architecture for Somalia will also include a comprehensive Integration, Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (IDDR) policy for the integration of grassroots forces, such as the “Macawisley”, into SSF and disarming, demobilising and reintegrating disengaged combatants into the society. These guidelines should align with constitutional provisions and the principles outlined in the revised 2023 NSArch to ensure smooth and lawful integration efforts. Initiative 4. Establishing Clear Guidelines for Integration and DDR Key Interventions: Strengthen collaboration between and among institutions at the federal and state levels. Reinforcing cooperative frameworks based on shared objectives Key Interventions: Uphold both the letter and the spirit of the provisional constitution. Optimise engagements with state and non-state stakeholders in strict compliance with the constitution and political agreement. Key Interventions: Develop policy for Integration, Disarmament, Demobilisa- tion and Reintegration (IDDR) for the integration of grassroots forces into Somali Security Forces Align Constitutional provisions with the revised 2023 NSArch. Reinforcing cooperative frameworks based on shared objectives. This initiative is dedicated to transforming the Somali National Armed Forces (SNAF) into a professional and accountable security force under robust civilian oversight. Efforts include strengthening command and control structures, enhancing operational readiness, and expanding training centres to support career progression and role specialisation. By improv- ing accountability and oversight mechanisms, the initiative ensures that the SNAF operates effectively and ethically while safeguarding Somalia’s sovereignty. Initiative 1. Building a Capable and Accountable Somali National Armed Forces (SNAF) Key Interventions: Transform SNAF into a professional and accountable security force. Enhance operational readiness, and expand training centres to support career progression and role speciali- sation. Strategic Objective: Strengthen Security Sector Capabilities Key Result Area 2: Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP) Case for Change Somalia’s security institutions, including the Somali National Armed Forces (SNAF) and Somali Police Force (SPF), are vital for national stability and public trust. However, both face challenges such as insufficient training, inadequate resources, and limited accountability, undermining their effectiveness in addressing security threats. These initiative aims to transform the SNAF and SPF into a professional and accountable force through improved command structures, expanded training, and robust oversight, enabling it to safeguard sovereignty and meet international standards. For the SPF, the focus is on increasing personnel to 40,000, enhancing operational readiness, and adopting community-focused policing to strengthen public trust and address localised security needs. By building well-equipped, ethical, and effective security forces, Somalia can establish a foundation for peace, stability, and long-term development. 59 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative focuses on improving SPF ability to maintain law and order and contribute to stabilisation efforts, particularly in newly liberated areas. By expanding the force size to 40,000 personnel and enhancing training facilities, the initiative ensures the SPF is well-equipped and operationally ready. Additionally, it aims to transition the police force into a community-focused and accountable institution, capable of fostering public trust and addressing security needs in urban and rural settings. Initiative 2. Enhancing the Somali Police Force’s Efficiency and Capacity Key Interventions: Improve SPF’s ability to maintain law and order and contribute to stabilisation efforts. Expand SPF 40,000 personnel and enhance training facilities Key Interventions: Build the Corps’ capabilities and enhance its capacity to deliver on its mandate. Bolster administrative structures, professional development, staffing expansion, and infrastructure development. Modernise Somalia’s Custodial Corps, ensuring its sustainability and alignment with international standards while contributing to enhanced public safety and justice delivery. Key Interventions: Safeguard Somalia’s maritime from threats and by enhancing surveillance, updating and enhancing law enforcement Improve governance over water resources The National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) operates under the framework of the Ministry of Internal Security (MoIS). It operates across various areas of security, encom- passing both policing and militarised activities, alongside its core intelligence functions. Meanwhile, regional administra- tions have either established or are in the process of develop- ing their own intelligence bodies. However, clear mechanisms for coordination, command, and reporting between these regional agencies and the NISA are still evolving. Through legislation apparatus and aligned reforms imple- mented by its own leadership, NISA’s functions will be stream- lined to make it more responsive to the intelligence needs of Somalia’s current security situation as well as lay the founda- tion as the cornerstone for the vision of Somalia security. Initiative 3. Enhancing National Intelligence Capabilities Key Interventions: Streamline NISA functions to make it more responsive to its core mandate of intelligence; Develop information sharing and intelligence architecture for collaboration and cooperation; This initiative aims to safeguard Somalia waters from threats by enhancing capabilities to deal with maritime threats through legislations and regulatory frameworks, regional cooperation, improving surveillance, updating and enhancing law enforcement. It focuses on improving surveillance in high-risk zones, strengthening counterterrorism operations, updating maritime laws, and clarifying jurisdictional boundar- ies. Its objective is also to improve governance over water resources. The initiative also prioritises training personnel, fostering regional and international partnerships, and enhanc- ing risk management and contingency planning frameworks. Initiative 5. Regulating Immigration, Customs and Border Control This initiative addresses the link between climate change and security. Climate change induced resource-based conflicts, loss of livelihood and displacements contribute to insecurity in Somalia. By integrating climate adaptation, conflict resolution, Initiative 6. Implementing Climate Adaptation Strategies to Reduce Resource-Based Conflicts The Custodial Corps plays a critical role in Somalia’s law and order/criminal justice system, encompassing detention, rehabilitation, and public safety. However, its effectiveness is hindered by outdated frameworks, insufficient training, limited administrative capacity, and inadequate infrastructure. This initiative aims to build the Corps’ capabilities and enhance its Initiative 4. Capacity Building of the Custodial Corps capacity to deliver on its mandate. Key objectives include bridging its roles in detention, rehabilitation, and public safety; strengthening administrative and managerial functions; modernising oversight mechanisms; refining recruitment and training protocols; and upgrading physical infrastructure. To achieve these goals, Key Interventions focus on regulatory reform and strategic planning, bolstering administrative structures, professional development, staffing expansion, and infrastructure development. By addressing these critical gaps, the initiative seeks to modernise Somalia’s Custodial Corps, ensuring its sustainability and alignment with international standards while contributing to enhanced public safety and justice delivery. 60 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Key Interventions: Integrate climate adaptation, conflict resolution, sustain- able development, and rule of law Engage women in active participation in security decision-making to promote gender-sensitive peacebuild- ing and protect vulnerable populations. Safeguard the nation’s sovereignty through stringent immigration controls, border security, and management of cross-border movements. Regulate immigration and naturalization, including the monitoring of asylum seekers, migrants, returnees and refugees. Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) is a crucial initiative for sustainable peace and stability in Somalia. It ensures women’s active participation in security decision-making, promotes gender-sensitive peacebuilding, and protects vulnerable populations. Aligning with national and international frame- works, WPS enhances the effectiveness of security institu- tions and fosters an inclusive society. Initiative 7. Promoting Women’s Participation in Security and Peacebuilding Immigration is essential for strengthening national security, ensuring public safety, and supporting effective governance. The Immigration and Citizenship Agency (ICA), through an inter-agency support mechanism, plays a vital role in safeguarding the nation’s sovereignty through stringent immigration controls, border security, and management of cross-border movements. By advancing its digital infrastruc- ture and biometric security measures, ICA needs to enhance its capacity to respond to evolving threats, ensuring the integrity of national processes. Regulating immigration and naturalization, including the monitoring of asylum seekers and refugees, is crucial to maintaining order and stability while supporting Somalia’s broader goals of security and develop- ment. Somalia’s porous borders, which is recognised as a national security threat in the national threat assessment, can be addressed through adequately resourced coordinated inter-agency framework to deal with transnational crimes and general cross-border insecurity. Initiative 8. Regulating Immigration Customs and Border Control Key Result Area 3: Counter-Terrorism Strategy Case for Change Somalia faces persistent threats from terrorist groups that have global ties, such as Al-Shabaab and ISIS. The presence of these terror- ist organisations has significantly impacted national security, political stability, border security and institutional capacities. The current counter-terrorism frameworks would benefit from a more comprehensive and multidimensional approach to address evolving threats. Therefore, enhancing these systems could help reduce potential vulnerabilities that terrorist groups might exploit. In light of this, a counter-terrorism strategy has been developed that translates into implementable initiatives to address the persistent threats posed by these groups. These groups exploit weak governance structures, socio-economic vulnerabilities, and porous borders to sustain their operations and undermine national sovereignty. This strategy prioritises liberating territories from terrorist groups’ control through military operations, strategic communications, countering terrorist financing, redesigning urban security, deploying local context specific PCVE, and stabilisation of territories recov- ered from terrorist groups. Communities impacted by terrorism often avoid cooperating with the government. Hence, the strategy shall also focus on rebuilding public trust and enhancing social resilience. Its initiatives should prioritise community engagement, rehabilitation programs, and the stabilisation of liberated areas to foster trust and support among local populations. Countering violent extremism (CVE) programs, particularly targeting youth and marginalised groups, can help address ideological extremism that fuel radicalisation and recruitment into terrorist organisations. and sustainable development, and rule of law, it aims to reduce tensions over critical resources like water and land. Through enhanced coordination, community dialogue, and climate security policies, Somalia seeks to build resilience, mitigate conflicts, and ensure long-term peace and stability. 61 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative will execute phased military operations targeting terrorist-controlled areas. Led by SNAF with support from all the other SSF, community defence forces and special forces, and international partners, these campaigns aim to liberate terrorist strongholds while minimizing civilian casualties. The phased approach ensures a sustainable transition to peace and stability in recovered areas. Initiative 1. Conducting Phased and Targeted Military Operations Strategic Objective: Build Counter Terrorism Capacities Key Interventions: Liberate terrorist strongholds by engaging community defence forces while maintain minimum civilian casual- ties This initiative will design and implement a synchronised national counter-terrorism communication strategy. The strategy will counter Al Shabaab and ISIS’s narratives, promote high-level defections, and highlight government successes in fostering peace and stability. This initiative will promote the successes of other counter terrorism efforts. Utilising public, private and multimedia platforms, it will engage various stakeholders to amplify messages of resilience and hope, undermining extremist propaganda. Initiative 4. Developing a National Counter-Terrorism Communication Strategy Key Interventions: Design and implement a synchronised national counter-terrorism communication strategy. To address the root causes of violent extremism, this initiative seeks to expand capabilities in preventing and countering violent extremism. It includes educational programs, count- er-narrative campaigns, and community engagement efforts specialised in for youth and less privileged groups. Collabora- tion with local communities and religious leaders will encour- age disengagement from violent extremism and promote national cohesion, contributing to long-term stability. Addition- ally, this initiative will lay the foundations to motivate defec- tions from the terrorist organisation and will provide better rehabilitation opportunities for defectors. Initiative 5. Expanding Prevention and Countering of Extremist Ideologies To secure newly recovered areas, this initiative establishes robust rule of law infrastructures and deploys police forces at both Federal State levels. Rapid response units and expanded community policing programs will foster trust and collabora- tion with local communities, ensuring sustained security and governance. In addition, security services complement stabilisation enablers such as humanitarian delivery and the provision of basic public services such as water, health and education with the support of international partners. Initiative 6. Strengthening Stabilisation in Recovered Areas Key Interventions: Carry out counter-narrative campaigns, and community engagement efforts targeting youth and less privileged groups. Collaborate with local communities and religious leaders to encourage disengagement from violent extremism and promote national cohesion. This initiative focuses on securing Somalia’s major urban centres, including Mogadishu and state capitals, through the development of tailored urban security strategy, including enhancing urban security infrastructures and deploying specialised units. Integrated support from international allies will ensure advanced technologies and training are leveraged to address urban security challenges effectively. This approach aims to safeguard civilians and critical assets, fostering a stable environment for development. Initiative 2. Enhancing Urban Security Key Interventions: Develop urban security strategy to secure Somalia’s major urban centres, including Mogadishu and state capitals. To dismantle terrorist groups’ financial networks, this initiative will implement advanced financial tracking systems and reinforce mandated institutions. A critical component will be integrating a National ID database and banking know your customer (KYC) system to monitor and block illicit financial flows. By enhancing oversight mechanisms, the initiative supports transparency and accountability in financial transac- tions, aligning with national and global anti-money laundering standards. Initiative 2. Enhancing Urban Security Key Interventions: Implement advanced financial tracking systems and reinforce mandated institutions Integrate a National ID database and banking KYC system to monitor and block illicit financial flows. Key Result Area 4: AUSSOM Transition of Security Responsibility to Somali Security Forces Case for Change With the mandate to prop-up Somalia’s security against existential threat from terrorist groups, AUSSOM also contributes to building the capacity and capabilities of the Somali Security Forces (SSF) and ultimately supporting the government’s goal in transferring all security responsibilities to the SSF in alignment with the Somali-led Security Architecture. The transition of security responsibilities from AUSSOM to the SSF is more than a tactical or operational shift. The UNSC mandate supports the broader vision of Somalia’s state-building efforts, linking security with governance, economic recovery, and sustainable development. The success of this transition is vital for creating the conditions necessary for a successful transition. Therefore, the timely and full implementation of the Mission’s mandate to support the implementation of the SSDP will guarantee a successful security transition. The joint and co-located feature of the Mission is aimed at fostering increased focus on capacity building and technical and logistical support of SSF alongside AUSSOM personnel. This involves close collaboration between SSF and AUSSOM personnel, focusing on skills transfer, joint operations, and the integration of best practices. The goal is to accelerate the development of the SSF and ensure that they are capable of managing security operations independently by the end of the mission. Key Result Area 5: Compliance With UNSC Obligations And Countering Transnational Crimes Case for Change To strengthen Somalia’s compliance with United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and enhance national security, the Central Monitoring Department (CMD) oversees the comprehensive overhaul of control, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms is essential. These mechanisms support key initiatives such as the National Weapons and Ammunition Management (WAM) Strategy, the Charcoal Ban, IED threat reduction, maritime interdiction, and enforcement of UNSC sanctions against Al-Shabaab. Current systems are fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in data collection, enforcement, and timely response to security threats. A more integrated and coordinated approach is needed to improve oversight and ensure accurate, timely reporting 62 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Strategic Objective: Security Transition to SSF Key Interventions: Establish robust rule of law infrastructures and deploys police forces at both Federal and State levels. Provide basic public services such as water, health and education With the mandate to prop-up Somalia’s security against existential threat from terrorist groups, AUSSOM also contributes to building the capacity and capabilities of the Somali Security Initiative 1. Strengthening the capabilities and capacity of the Somali Security Forces This intervention focuses on enhancing the training, resourc- es, and operational capacity of the SSF to ensure they are fully equipped to maintain security in Somalia. The objective is to ensure that the SSF can effectively manage security responsi- bilities after AUSSOM's exit, reducing dependency on interna- tional support. Key Interventions: Enhance the training, resources, and operational capacity of the SSF to assume security responsibilities after AUSSOM's exit, reducing dependency on international support. 63 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Revamping these mechanisms will improve monitoring of weapons stockpiles, facilitate the UNSC charcoal ban’s implementation, and strengthen counter-IED efforts. It will also enhance information-sharing between Somali authorities, the Panel of Experts and transi- tion of its role to CMD, and international partners to ensure more effective arms embargo enforcement and other components of UNSCR 2713 (2023). Improved maritime security and counter-smuggling measures will disrupt terrorist financing and bolster Soma- lia’s maritime domain awareness. Additionally, the overhaul should address the issue of illegal weapons held by non-proscribed non-state actors, such as clan militias, which contribute to instability. A sustainable mechanism to disarm these groups in the long run is crucial, requiring cooperation between local leaders, national authorities, and international partners. Equally important is the integration and/or demobilisation of community defence forces into Somalia’s security forces or reintegrating them into the community to lead a productive civilian life. This process will help reduce militia influence, promote security sector reform, and support reintegration through training and social programs. In summary, revamping Somalia’s control, monitoring, and reporting systems will enhance UNSC compliance, improve security, and create pathways for the reintegration of non-state actors into the formal security apparatus, ultimately fostering a safer and more stable environment for all Somalis. Finally, the CMD oversees the overall monitoring of transnational crimes including but not limited to the implementation of the charcoal ban and arms trafficking measures. In addition, the CMD supports the strengthened capacity and capabilities of the SSF in order to facilitate the effective implementation of the government’s anti-smuggling measure. The CMD leads the coordinated execution of Somalia's Nation- al Weapons and Ammunition Management (WAM) Strategy. The ONS guarantees adherence to UNSCR obligations while addressing weapons lifecycle management and strengthening cooperation. Initiative 1. Implementation of National WAM Strategy Strategic Objective: Strengthening Somalia's national security and UNSC compliance through integrated control, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms. Key Interventions: Coordinated execution of Somalia’s National Weapons and Ammunition Management (WAM) Strategy. Aligned with UNSCR 2713 (2023), CMD drafts and oversees the implementation of legislations and policies, monitoring of explosive precursors, and professional training for Explosive Ordinance Disposal teams thereby strengthening Somalia's capabilities to fight IED threats. This program reduces dangers and improves public safety by encouraging awareness and following the sources of IED components Initiative 3. Addressing the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) Key Interventions: Implement legislations and policies, monitoring of explosive precursors, and professional training for Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams thereby strengthen- ing Somalia's capabilities to fight IED threats. The CMD supports the government’s SSF to have strength- ened surveillance, interdiction, and counter-smuggling measures to disrupt illicit flows financing terrorism. This includes fisheries protection, port law enforcement capaci- ty-building, and collaboration with UNODC and global partners to improve maritime domain awareness and enforcement. Initiative 4. Maritime interdiction and maritime domain awareness Key Interventions: Port law enforcement capacity-building, and collabora- tion with UNODC and global partners to improve maritime domain awareness and enforcement. The CMD oversees the implementation of the UNSC charcoal ban to curb the illicit financing of terrorism as well as its environmental impact. The CMD supports the monitoring of stockpiles and ensures their proper disposal in order to stop the illicit trade and its exploitation Initiative 2. Implementation of the Charcoal Ban Key Interventions: Implement of the UNSC charcoal ban to curb the illicit financing of terrorism as well as its environmental impact. 64 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 2.4. Enablers By means of open reporting and close collaboration with the Panel of Experts, CMD ensures Somalia’s compliance with the UNSC arms embargo on Al-Shabaab. This includes facilitating inspections, providing access to facilities and records, and sharing detailed reports on arms flows and stockpile manage- ment. The initiative contributes to national and international security by fostering information exchange, addressing gender considerations, and implementing actionable recom- Initiative 5.

Chapter 3: Rule of Law 3.1. Overview O B J E C T I V E : Reforming the Judiciary Somalia has made progress in strengthening its justice and rule of law framework, beginning to lay the groundwork for a more equita- ble and accountable system. Since 2012, efforts to re-establish rule of law institutions have led to tangible achievements, including the operationalisation of courts and Attorney General’s Offices in major urban centres, the establishment of critical bodies like the Judiciary Training Institute (JTI) and progress toward finalising a political agreement on Somalia’s justice and corrections model. However, gaps remain including the absence of a Constitutional Court and a Judicial Service Commission, as well as limited capaci- ty and poor infrastructure. Key legal and institutional advancements include the enactment of the National Disability Act, progress in legislating the Rape and Indecency Offenses Bill, the Child Rights Bill, Juvenile Justice Bill, and the Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Bill. The ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2019 and the establishment of the National Disability Agency in 2018 further demonstrate Somalia’s intent to uphold human rights and strengthen inclusivity. Additionally, the FGS has made strides in reaching a political agree- ment on the country’s justice and corrections structure, enabling collaboration among federal and state-level institutions. This progress, alongside stabilisation efforts in newly recovered regions, has created opportunities to expand access to justice, reinforce the rule of law, and ensure the inclusion of marginalised groups. However, foundational structural and operational challenges remain. The judiciary operates under a fragmented legal frame- work that combines elements of Italian civil law, British common law, customary Xeer, and Shari’a law. These inconsistencies, coupled with outdated legal instruments such as the Penal and Civil Codes, impede justice delivery and create jurisdictional conflicts between federal and state courts. The lack of oversight mechanisms, such as the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and Constitutional Court, further undermines judicial independence and accountability. Court administration suffers from inefficiencies, including manual case handling, delays, and inadequate infrastructure, limiting citizens’ access to justice. Corrections and detention systems are overcrowded, poorly managed, and fail to meet human rights standards. While progress has been made in human rights legisla- tion, resistance to key laws, such as the FGM Bill and Rape and Indecency Offenses Bill, reflects the challenge of aligning interna- tional standards with Somalia’s socio-cultural and religious values. 66 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 3.1. Overview Somalia’s justice and human rights framework will be transformed to ensure equitable access to justice, uphold human dignity, and build public trust in governance. Addressing the structural, legal, and administrative challenges will strengthen the justice sector’s capacity to deliver fair, transparent, and inclusive services, fostering national stability and development. The pathway to achieving this vision begins with comprehensive legal and institutional reform to harmonise outdated laws and operationalise critical oversight bodies like the Judicial Service Commission and Constitutional Court. These reforms will enhance judicial independence, transparency, and accountability, laying a strong foundation for an equitable legal system. To expand access to justice, investments will be made in infrastructure, mobile courts, and legal aid services to reach marginalised communities, ensuring justice is accessible regardless of geographic or financial barriers. Strengthening the Somali Bar Association will further enhance the quality and professionalism of legal services. Modernising judicial administration through digital case management systems, specialized courts, and improved inter-agency collaboration will increase efficiency, reduce delays, and restore public confidence. Simultaneously, corrections and detention reform will address overcrowding, improve facility conditions, and ensure compliance with human rights standards. Finally, advancing human rights, dignity, and inclusion will integrate vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, into governance, education, and public life. By balancing international human rights standards with Sharia principles and cultural values, Somalia will create an inclusive justice system that protects its citizens and promotes societal cohesion. FIGURE 8: HOUSE CHART: KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR JUDICIAL REFORM9 Legal and Institutional Reform Enacting/reviewing laws and aligning them with international human rights standards through the Law Reform Commission, establishing/im- proving and operationalising key justice institutions and instruments, modernisation/ digitalisation of the justice system chain, and enhanc- ing sector collaboration. Access to Justice 1. 2. is crucial, especially for vulnerable groups such as women, children, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Key efforts include expanding free legal aid services, deploying mobile courts in remote areas, and training legal professionals in gender-sensitive and child-friendly practic- es. Public awareness campaigns will help individuals understand their legal rights, while efforts to reduce legal fees and language barriers will promote inclusivity. Collaboration with civil society, traditional leaders, and government institutions will strengthen legal service delivery. 67 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Legal and Institutional Reform Focuses on humane treatment, reducing overcrowding, and enhancing rehabilitation and reintegration programs. Expanding prison infrastructure, introducing alternative sentencing like parole and community service, and providing vocational training will support inmate reintegration. Improved healthcare, including mental health services, and training corrections staff in human rights-based practices will ensure compliance with international standards. Sustainable reforms will require coordinated efforts from government, civil society, and international partners. The first pillar, Justice Sector Legal and Institutional Reform, focuses on strengthening legal frameworks and judicial institutions. This includes amending the Provisional Constitution to define judicial roles and powers clearly, enacting the High Judicial Council Act to oversee appointments and ethics, and harmonising federal and state laws to reduce jurisdictional conflicts. Additionally, the Law Reform Commission will align domestic laws with international human rights standards. Institutions such as the Justice Academy and Judicial Services Commis- sion will be operationalised to enhance professional development and accountability within the judiciary. The second pillar, Expanding Access to Justice, addresses geographic and socio-economic barriers that limit access to legal services. This includes establishing formal court facilities in underserved areas and deploying mobile courts to reach remote communities, including extending the state’s justice footprint to newly recovered areas in the ongoing counter-insurgency efforts. Legal aid clinics and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms will be expanded to serve vulnerable groups, including women, children, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Nationwide public awareness campaigns will educate citizens about their legal rights and available services, fostering greater trust and engagement with the formal justice system The third pillar, Corrections System Modernisation, targets systemic deficiencies in Somalia’s correctional facilities. Planned Key Interven- tions include improving infrastructure, enhancing staff training, and introducing rehabilitative programs. Six existing prisons will be renovated, and four new facilities will be constructed to reduce overcrowding. Vocational training and reintegration programs will prepare inmates for productive reintegration into society, while capacity-building initiatives for custodial staff will ensure humane and professional management. Mental health services will also be prioritised, addressing the psychological well-being of inmates and staff. These integrated reforms aim to produce beneficial outcomes across the country’s rule of law system. Legal and institutional reforms will establish a cohesive and transparent justice framework, with harmonised laws and merit-based judicial appointments ensuring greater consistency and fairness. Access to justice initiatives will bridge the urban-rural divide, enabling underserved populations to seek redress through formal and alterna- tive mechanisms. Enhanced public awareness will empower citizens to engage with the legal system, contributing to a culture of accountabil- ity. Modernised correctional facilities and rehabilitative programs will reduce recidivism, improve living conditions, and support the success- ful reintegration of former inmates into society. Professional development for correctional staff will promote ethical practices, transparency, and effective management. These outcomes collectively aim to restore public trust in the justice system, reduce systemic discrimination, and align Somalia’s rule of law framework with international standards. The long-term impact of these reforms is a just, equitable, and resilient Somalia, where the rule of law upholds human rights, ensures accountability, and fosters national cohesion. By integrating statutory, customary, and Sharia laws within a unified framework, Somalia will create a legal system that reflects its cultural diversity while adhering to global norms. Strengthened justice and corrections systems will contribute to long-term stability, economic development, and national reconciliation. The NTP I represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the systemic weaknesses and structural gaps in its rule of law framework. By focusing on legal reforms, access to justice, and corrections modernisation, the NTP I provide a cohesive roadmap in order to achieve a transparent, equitable, and effective justice system. With strong political will and collective action, Somalia can build a foundation for peace, stability, and sustainable development, ensuring justice and human rights for all its citizens. 3. 68 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative focuses on addressing foundational gaps in Somalia’s legal and judicial framework by updating, finalising, and enacting key legal instruments essential for the judiciary’s effective functioning and alignment with a federal governance system and international laws. Central to this effort is the Judiciary Structure Act, which will codify the roles, jurisdic- tions, and hierarchy of Somalia’s judiciary, ensuring it reflects constitutional principles and supports federalism. The initiative prioritises the harmonisation and modernisation of Somalia’s outdated laws, including the Penal Code, Civil Code, and other essential legal frameworks. These laws will be revised to align with contemporary governance needs, interna- tional legal standards, and the realities of Somalia’s plural legal traditions, creating a cohesive and inclusive legal system. A significant component of this initiative is the establishment of clear jurisdictional boundaries between federal and state courts. This will resolve inconsistencies, reduce jurisdictional conflicts, and provide clarity in judicial processes. Initiative 1. Establish and Operationalise Core Legal Instruments Strategic Objective: Foundational Legal and Institutional Reform Key Interventions: Strengthen judicial independence and administrative autonomy. Remove ambiguities in judicial oversight and enhance checks and balances between government branches. Key Result Area 1: Legal and Institutional Reform Case for Change Somalia’s justice sector faces systemic challenges, including fragmented legal frameworks, inadequate judicial independence, and outdated laws and institutional structures. These challenges have hindered the effective delivery of justice, eroded public trust, and compromised compliance with international legal standards. Addressing these issues is critical to strengthening the rule of law and fostering public confidence in Somalia’s legal system. This initiative prioritises the establishment or operationalisation of core legal instruments, including finalising the amendments to the Provisional Constitution, developing a new Organisation of the Judiciary Law, and establishing the Judicial Service Commission and the Constitutional Court. These measures aim to clarify judicial roles, reduce jurisdictional conflicts, and create a unified legal framework. Legislative reforms, such as the operationalisation of the Law Reform Commission and the drafting of the Somali Bar Association Act, will align Somalia’s laws with governance needs and international human rights obligations while regulating the legal profession. Incorporating key international treaties, such as the Convention Against Torture, into domestic laws and building judicial capacity will ensure compliance with global standards. Modernising judicial administration through digitalisation and performance metrics will enhance efficiency, transparency, and public trust. Strengthening institutions like the High Judicial Council and Somalia school of law will promote accountability and continuous professional development, while the establishment of a Justice Sector Coordination Forum is expected to improve interagency collab- oration and information-sharing. Collectively, these reforms will provide a foundation for a resilient, transparent, and efficient justice sector that upholds the rule of law and advances Somalia’s national development goals. 3.3. Key Result Areas Amend and Finalise the Provisional Constitution Define the structure, jurisdiction, and operational guidelines for courts at federal and state levels. Clarify the jurisdictional boundaries between federal and state courts to prevent conflicts. Develop and Amend the Organisation of the Judiciary Act Establish a transparent and merit-based framework for judicial appointments and oversight. Strengthen ethical guidelines and judicial accountability mechanisms. Enact the High Judicial Council Act 69 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative focuses on establishing and strengthening judicial institutions, such as the High Judicial Council and the Justice Academy. The JSC will serve as a critical oversight body, tasked with ensuring transparency and meritocracy in judicial appointments, promotions, discipline, and dismissals. By institutionalising the JSC, Somalia can establish clear frameworks for judicial accountability, performance monitor- ing, and adherence to ethical standards, thereby restoring and strengthening public confidence in the judiciary. These institu- tions will enhance judicial accountability, enforce ethics, and provide continuous professional development for legal practi- tioners. Somalia currently lacks robust performance evaluation mech- anisms to hold judges accountable for the quality of their adjudication or justice services. Without such oversight, inefficiency, corruption, and meritocratic appointments persist, further eroding public trust in the judiciary. To address this, the introduction of performance monitoring systems will be essential to evaluate judicial outcomes and track the quality of justice service delivery. Transparent mechanisms for judicial appointments, promo- tions, and disciplinary actions will ensure that these processes are merit-based and free from political interference. In tandem, this initiative prioritises the operationalisation of the Constitutional Court, a key institution mandated to address constitutional disputes, ensure compliance with federal principles, and uphold the rule of law. Establishing the Constitutional Court will provide a vital mechanism for resolv- ing conflicts between federal and state governments and safeguarding the constitutional order. This will reinforce the foundations of a transparent, accountable, and independent judicial system. The expected outcomes include the operationalisation of the High Judicial Council and the establishment of the Somali School of Law. These institutions will improve institutional capacity, promote ethical governance, and ensure the judicia- ry’s effectiveness. Initiative 2. Operationalise Core Legal and Judicial Institutions Key Interventions: Oversee the drafting and implementation of laws aligned with Somalia’s governance needs and international standards. Operationalise the Law Reform Commission Operationalise the High Judicial Council, and the Somalia School of Law to improve judicial oversight, training, and governance. Establish specialised courts to handle family, commer- cial, and juvenile cases. Establish and Operationalise the Constitutional Court to resolve constitutional disputes and uphold compliance with federal governance principles. Establish and Strengthen Core Judicial Institutions Conduct consultative processes involving federal and state stakeholders to address jurisdictional conflicts and standardise judicial procedures. Ensure alignment with international legal standards and Somalia’s plural legal traditions. Harmonise Federal and State-Level Laws Update these codes to reflect contemporary governance needs and international human rights standards. Ensure alignment with Somalia’s federal structure and legal traditions. Revise and Modernise the Penal Code and Civil Code Review and incorporate relevant international conven- tions into Somalia’s legal framework. Ensure the recognition and formalisation of customary and religious legal practices in alignment with constitu- tional principles. Strengthen International Treaty Compliance and Customary Legal Integration Implement the Somalia Bar Association Act and human rights legislation to safeguard vulnerable groups and promote legal reforms. Incorporate key international treaties into Somalia’s legal framewor 70 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Judicial administration will be modernised by digitising court systems to streamline case management and improve transparency. Standardised performance indicators will be introduced to monitor judicial efficiency and effectiveness. Expected outcomes include digitalised court systems that enhance efficiency and transparency and standardised perfor- mance metrics to evaluate institutional effectiveness. These reforms will reduce delays and improve public trust in the justice system Initiative 1. Modernise Judicial Administration This initiative aims to enhance coordination and communica- tion among key Rule of Law institutions, including the courts, police, prosecutors, corrections, the Ministry of Justice, the Judiciary, and the Office of the Attorney General. Currently, fragmented communication and misaligned priorities among these entities lead to inefficiencies, delays, and ineffective justice delivery. By fostering collaboration and improving coordination mechanisms, this initiative will ensure that the justice system operates as an integrated and cohesive entity. A key component of this initiative is the establishment of the Justice Sector Coordination Forum, which will serve as a platform for institutional dialogue, resource mobilisation, policy alignment, and information sharing. This forum will standardise procedures for case management, align institu- tional priorities, and improve overall efficiency in justice sector operations. Strengthened interagency coordination will also facilitate streamlined reform efforts, reduce duplications, and promote collaborative governance, ultimately resulting in a more effective and responsive justice system. Initiative 2. Strengthen Rule of Law Sector Coordination and Interagency Collaboration Strategic Objective: To modernise and professionalise Somalia’s judicial administration and systems by streamlining processes, reducing delays, enhancing inter-agency collaboration, and integrating specialised mechanisms such as forensic capabilities, ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficient justice service delivery Provide a transparent mechanism for resolving conflicts between federal and state governments. Clearly define jurisdictional boundaries between federal and state courts to improve judicial efficiency. Introduce digital systems to modernise court administra- tion, enabling efficient case tracking, secure record management, and enhanced transparency in judicial processes. This will reduce delays, prevent document loss, and improve overall efficiency in case handling. Establish a forensic institute to enhance investigative and prosecutorial capacity through modern forensic tools and expertise. This will improve evidence collection, analysis, and preservation, leading to stronger cases, higher conviction rates, and increased public confidence in the justice system Key Result Area 2: Improving Judicial Administration and Systems Case for Change Somalia’s judicial system suffers from significant administrative inefficiencies that undermine the delivery of justice and erode public trust. The absence of specialised courts exacerbates the problem, as judges are required to act as generalists, handling a wide range of cases without the expertise or focus needed to effectively adjudicate complex legal matters. Another critical issue is the lack of robust digital systems to support case processing and institutional operations. The reliance on manual handling of documents not only leads to frequent loss or mishandling of case files but also exposes sensitive information to confidentiality risks, reflecting systemic weaknesses in court administration. These inefficiencies further fuel percep- tions of corruption, as the lack of transparency hampers oversight and makes accountability nearly impossible. Inter-agency collaboration among courts, police, prosecutors, and corrections is also poorly coordinated. Misaligned priorities, insuffi- cient communication, and inconsistent processes across these institutions result in fragmented justice delivery, contributing to delays and inefficiencies at every stage of the judicial process. To address these issues, Somalia must modernise court administration by introducing digital case management systems to enhance efficiency, improve document security, and facilitate inter-agency collaboration. Establishing specialised courts will ensure that cases are adjudicated by judges with the appropriate expertise, leading to more consistent and effective outcomes. By implementing these measures, Somalia can improve transparency, reduce delays, and restore public trust in the judicial system. Modernising court admin- istration will enhance oversight and accountability, strengthen inter-agency coordination, and ensure that justice is delivered efficiently, equitably, and in alignment with the rule of law. Key Interventions: 71 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative focuses on renovating existing court facilities and constructing new courts in underserved and newly recov- ered regions, especially as part of stabilisation efforts. Improved infrastructure will enhance access to formal justice systems, signal the government’s commitment to justice reform, and provide a visible presence of state authority in areas transitioning from conflict. Mobile courts will be deployed to reach remote communities, addressing local disputes and providing accessible legal services. Initiative 1. Establish Formal Court Facilities Strategic Objective: To provide equitable access to legal services across Somalia’s urban, peri-urban, and rural areas, prioritising vulnerable populations, newly recovered regions, and underserved communities by addressing barriers of cost, distance, and inadequate infrastructure Key Interventions: Establish the Justice Sector Coordination Forum to facilitate dialogue, resource mobilisation, and policy alignment among key justice institutions. Strengthen coordination among the Ministries of Justice at both federal and state levels, Judiciary, Office of the Attorney General, police, prosecutors, and corrections to improve efficiency in justice delivery. Develop standardised case management procedures to streamline justice processes and reduce delays. Key Interventions: Renovate existing court facilities and construct new ones in underserved areas to increase access to justice. Construction of New Courts: Establish courts in under- served and newly stabilised regions to enhance judicial reach. Provision of Essential Equipment: Supply courts with necessary infrastructure, including IT systems, case management tools, and security enhancements. Capacity Building: Train judicial staff and court personnel to effectively manage and operate new and renovated court facilities. Deploy mobile courts to reach remote communities, addressing local disputes and provide accessible legal services Key Result Area 3: Expanding Access to Justice Case for Change Somalia’s justice system faces significant barriers to accessibility, particularly for underserved and remote communities. Limited infrastructure, insufficient outreach, and a lack of affordable legal services have left many citizens reliant on traditional mechanisms that often fail to uphold human rights standards. Courts in many areas are outdated, overcrowded, and poorly equipped, while newly recovered regions from conflict lack functioning judicial facilities. These gaps in access to justice perpetuate inequality and prevent vulnerable populations, including women, youth, and minority groups, from engaging with formal legal systems. Citizens in rural and remote areas are often unable to access legal services due to geographic and financial barriers. Mobile courts and legal aid clinics are critical to bringing justice closer to marginalised communities, resolving disputes, reducing case backlogs, and improving legal literacy. Another significant challenge is the absence of a fully functional Somali Bar Association (SBA). While operational, the SBA lacks a legal foundation due to stalled legislation. Without this framework, the legal profession is poorly regulated, leading to inconsistent standards and unethical practices. The SBA’s inability to accredit legal practitioners, organise continuing legal education (CLE), or enforce disciplinary measures has further eroded public trust in the legal system. Moreover, the lack of clinical legal education initiatives and support for pro-bono legal services limits access to justice for indigent defendants and marginalised groups. Addressing these barriers is essential to fostering trust in the judiciary and creating an inclusive and equitable justice system. Expand- ing legal infrastructure, deploying mobile courts, strengthening legal aid mechanisms, and operationalising the SBA will enable Soma- lia to provide justice services that are accessible, fair, and aligned with international human rights standards. 72 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative focuses on expanding legal aid clinics and institutionalising ADR mechanisms to reduce court backlogs and address the needs of vulnerable populations. Simplifying legal processes will make justice more accessible to marginal- ised groups. Expected outcomes include increased access to justice for vulnerable populations and reduced court caseloads through the adoption of ADR. Enhanced public satisfaction with the justice system will be a key result Initiative 2. Strengthen Legal Aid and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanisms Expand legal aid clinics and institutionalise ADR mechanism to reduce court backlogs and address the needs of vulnerable populations. Key Result Area 4: Corrections System Reform Case for Change Somalia’s corrections system faces critical structural and operational challenges that undermine public safety, human rights compli- ance, and effective rehabilitation. Overcrowded facilities, inadequate infrastructure, and the lack of rehabilitation programs hinder the justice system’s ability to reintegrate former offenders into society. Many correctional facilities suffer from poor sanitation, insufficient healthcare services, and outdated security measures, exacerbating detainee hardships and contributing to high recidivism rates. Additionally, mental health services remain scarce, further impeding efforts to create a rehabilitative environment. The limited professional capacity of the Custodial Corps, coupled with outdated oversight mechanisms, results in inconsistencies in detention management, staff shortages, and ineffective rehabilitation efforts. Correctional officers lack adequate training and resourc- es to implement international human rights standards, reducing public confidence in the justice system. Furthermore, Somalia's correctional system lacks structured reintegration programs, making it difficult for former offenders to transition successfully back into society. To address these deficiencies, Somalia must undertake comprehensive corrections system reform by constructing and renovating correctional facilities, enhancing detainee rehabilitation services, strengthening the Custodial Corps, and integrating mental health services. Expanding alternative sentencing mechanisms will also alleviate prison overcrowding while ensuring that incarceration remains a tool for rehabilitation rather than punishment alone. These reforms will modernise Somalia’s corrections system, improve public safety, and uphold international human rights commitments. Key Interventions: Ensuring access to justice for persons with disabilities is a fundamental goal of this initiative. This initiative focuses on removing physical, communication, and attitudinal barriers in the justice system. Measures include developing an Online Dispute Resolution platform, establishing legal aid services tailored to persons with disabilities, and adapting prisons and detention facilities to ensure accessibility. Comprehensive training for security forces, judges, and legal personnel will further enhance the capacity of the justice system to support persons with disabilities Initiative 3. Justice for Persons with Disabilities Remove physical, communication, and attitudinal barriers in the justice system. Develop an Online Dispute Resolution platform, establish- ing legal aid services tailored to persons with disabilities.

Enablers Chapter 4: Public Sector Management and Results Delivery O B J E C T I V E : Improving Public Sector Management and Results Delivery UN SDGs Addressed: Introduces digital governance initiatives. Strengthens civil service accountability and efficiency. 4.1. Overview Somalia's public sector reform journey has been profoundly shaped by its turbulent history, particularly following the collapse of the central government in 1991. In the aftermath of the civil conflict, the country faced the monumental task of rebuilding state institutions, which had been severely weakened by decades of instability and governance collapse. These challenges have persisted, compounded by corruption, political instability, and fragile institutions, making public sector reform a critical priority for the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS). Public sector initiatives aim to restore governance systems and public services by enhancing the efficiency, accountability, and responsiveness of government institutions. Key reforms focused on reinforcing civil service structures, strengthening policy and legal frameworks, and laying the groundwork for sustainable public administration. Over the past decade, successive Somali governments, in collaboration with international partners like the United Nations, the World Bank, and development agencies, have implemented impactful reforms, including capacity- building programmes and public finance management initiatives. 76 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 - 10 77 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 9: GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS INDEX 2022 FIGURE 10: CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX IN SOMALIA VS EAC11 One major achievement of these Key Interventions was Somalia’s reintegration into the international financial system, marked by successful debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Programmes like the World Bank’s Capacity Injection Program (CIP) improved institutional capacity by embedding skilled workers into key government positions, while the Somalia Stability Fund (SSF) and Public Resource Management in Somalia (PREMIS) initiatives focused on rebuild- ing public finance systems and civil services within federal member states. These efforts have been instrumental in strength- ening governance structures and improving the delivery of public services. Despite this progress, ongoing challenges, including governance inefficiencies continue to impede development. Somalia’s low scores on the Government Effectiveness Index (-2.03) and Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI), where it ranked 11 out of 100 in 2023, underscore the need for deeper, more targeted reforms. Public trust remains eroded by institutional fragility, weak enforcement mechanisms, and politicisation within civil service structures. Additionally, the marginalisation of citizen engagement in governance processes has limited the effectiveness of accountability mecha- nisms. 78 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Challenges & Opportunities for Public Sector Management Reforms FIGURE 11: E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT INDEX FOR SOMALIA VS EAC12 Restoring institutional integrity and fostering transparency are at the heart of Somalia’s public sector reform agenda. Corrup- tion, which has led Somalia to rank as the most corrupt country globally, remains a significant challenge. Strengthening anti-corruption initiatives, enforcing accountability mechanisms, and implementing policies that promote fairness and transparency are essential steps for rebuilding public trust. The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) by the African Development Bank further highlights these issues, with Somalia’s public sector management and institutions scoring only 1.9 out of 6, reflecting the scale of challenges in governance, transparency, and policymaking. Digital transformation also holds immense potential for improving public sector management and service delivery in Somalia. However, the country’s digital infrastructure remains underdeveloped, characterised by fragmented e-government services, low digital literacy, and limited ICT systems. Strategic investments in digital infrastructure, capacity building, and a unified digital strategy are necessary to bridge the digital divide and elevate Somalia’s e-government capabilities to align with regional and global standards. Embracing technology can improve citizen engagement, streamline public administration, and enhance the transparency and efficiency of government operations. There is growing political will to address these systemic weaknesses and embark on a comprehensive reform agenda. This commitment, supported by international partners, technological advancements, and the potential for citizen-centred engage- ment, is a critical foundation for addressing glaring institutional, financial, and human resource inefficiencies. These reforms must prioritise civil service professionalisation, merit-based recruitment, and the independence of government institutions from political pressures. By strengthening public administration systems and implementing targeted anti-corruption measures, Somalia can foster good governance, promote sustainable development, and rebuild public trust in government functions. Somalia’s public sector reform faces various challenges that cut across governance, civil servant management, and digital transformation. The challenges—ranging from institutional fragility, resource constraints, and weak enforcement mecha- nisms to systemic corruption, insufficient public engagement, and underdeveloped digital infrastructure—pose serious obsta- cles to reform. These challenges are deeply entrenched, affecting governance, civil servant management, and digital transfor- mation efforts. At the same time, significant opportunities present pathways to strengthen governance, accountability, and service delivery, to rebuild its institutions and restore public trust. Recognizing the urgent need for change, Somalia is under- taking ambitious reforms to improve institutional integrity, strengthen civil servant management, and embrace digital transformation. These efforts aim to modernise public sector operations, enhance service delivery, and create a more transparent and accountable government. 79 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Structural and Institutional Challenges vs. Reform Opportunities The fragility of Somalia’s public sector institutions is a key challenge, with limited capacity for effective governance, outdated legal frameworks, and weak enforcement mechanisms. This structural weakness perpetuates systemic corruption, undermines institutional integrity, and diminishes public trust. In addition, ineffective collaboration among key integrity institutions and the lack of whistle-blower protections exacerbates a culture of impuni- ty. Civil servant management is similarly constrained by outdated recruitment processes, insufficient training infrastructure, and political interference. Digital transformation efforts face logistical and technical hurdles, such as underdeveloped IT infrastructure, limited internet penetra- tion in rural areas, and low digital literacy. Despite these obstacles, Somalia can leverage significant opportunities to strengthen its public sector. Institutional reforms, guided by international best practices which can enhance accountability and service delivery. Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms offer a critical oppor- tunity to improve fiscal discipline and transparency, laying a founda- tion for institutional resilience. Establishing a civil service training institute and automating perfor- mance management systems through HRMIS can professionalise the workforce and enhance service delivery. In digital transforma- tion, developing e-government platforms and implementing the Somali National ID system provide avenues to modernise public administration and facilitate data-driven policymaking. Governance, Engagement, and Transparency Challenges vs. Civic Empowerment Opportunities Governance reforms are hampered by limited public engagement, weak oversight mechanisms, and insufficient transparency in government processes. Civil society organisations and the media often lack the resources and capacity to investigate and expose corruption effectively, weakening public pressure for accountability. Furthermore, citizens face barriers to accessing government services and participating in governance processes, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Opportunities for civic empowerment and governance reform are promising. By building robust public engagement mechanisms, Somalia can empower citizens to participate in governance, hold institutions accountable, and drive demand for transparency. Digital tools such as centralised e-government platforms and the Somali National ID system can improve access to services, foster inclusion, and enhance citizen trust. Strengthening legal and regulatory frame- works to protect whistle-blowers, promote transparency, and align with international standards can provide a solid foundation for public accountability. Empowering civil society organisations and fostering media independence can further enhance oversight and advocacy, amplify- ing the collective push for governance reforms. Somalia’s transfor- mation agenda is at a critical juncture. While the journey toward an efficient, transparent, and accountable public sector is complex, the opportunities available provide a roadmap for success. By address- ing the structural, resource, and governance challenges with target- ed reforms and leveraging technological innovation and internation- al collaboration, Somalia can build a more resilient and responsive public sector This will not only enhance the delivery of public services but also restore public trust, strengthen governance, and lay the groundwork for sustainable national development. Resource and Capacity Constraints vs. Development Opportunities Severe resource constraints—ranging from insufficient funding to inadequate technological infrastructure and a shortage of skilled personnel—undermine reform efforts across all sectors. Public institutions struggle to implement necessary reforms without the financial means to invest in infrastructure, capacity-building, or technological advancements. The lack of cybersecurity profession- als further hinders the ability to protect digital infrastructure and ensure secure government operations. Opportunities for resource development abound, however, Somalia can mobilise international partnerships to secure financial and technical resources for transformative projects. For instance, the expansion of the Somali National ID system and the establishment of a Security Operations Centre (SOC) can benefit from international collaboration, bringing in expertise and funding. Rebuilding civil service infrastructure, including training facilities and HR systems, provides a chance to address resource gaps. Investing in digital tools, such as e-governance platforms and automated reporting systems, can streamline processes, improve service delivery, and enhance public sector efficiency. 4.2. Theory of Change 80 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Somalia’s public sector reform represents an ambitious yet vital endeavour to rebuild trust in institutions, enhance governance, and foster long-term socio-economic development. The Somali public sector has long grappled with structural weaknesses, resource constraints, systemic corruption, and outdated frameworks that hinder service delivery and governance effectiveness. The politicisation of civil service, widespread nepotism, and insuffi- cient meritocratic processes failed to instil public trust. Furthermore, the absence of robust accountability mechanisms and fragmented digital infrastructure exacerbates inefficiencies. Despite these hurdles, Somalia’s growing political will, international partnerships, and technological advancements present a unique opportunity for reform if it intends to achieve the goals set out in CV2060 and the NTP I. The NTP I outlines the pathways to addressing systemic weaknesses and transforming the public sector into a responsive, accountable, and citizen-focused system capable of delivering efficient and equitable services. These initiatives will be spearheaded by the relevant and respective government institutions. Anchored in Soma- lia’s National Transformation Plan 2025-2029, the reform agenda revolves around three interconnected KRAs: The first Key Result Area (KRA) pillar, public service and civil servant management, focuses on professionalising the workforce through merit-based recruitment, competency- driven performance systems, and the establishment of the Somalia School of Government and National Civil Service Commission (NCSC) facilities. Automation through an HR Management Information System (HRMIS) aims to streamline processes and enhance effective service delivery. The second Key Result Area (KRA) pillar, institutional integrity and accountability, reinstates independence of anti-corruption commission, establishes anti-corruption court/unit, and promotes ethical governance through transparency initiatives and whistle-blower protections. Strengthened institutional integrity and anti-corruption measures will rebuild public trust and ensure equitable governance FIGURE 12: HOUSE CHART: KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM13 Improving Public Service and Civil Servant Management focuses on building a professional, merit-based workforce through structured training, competency-driven perfor- mance systems, and streamlined operations via HRMIS automation. Enhancing Institutional Integrity and Accountability aims to combat corruption by empowering independent oversight bodies, establishing specialised courts, and promoting transparency through robust governance practices and whistleblower protections. Government Digital Transformation aims to centralise government services into a single, secure and accessible digital platform By reducing bureaucratic complexities, this initiative will streamline service delivery and improve citizen engage- ment with the public sector. Increased efficiency in access- ing government services and improved public satisfaction with service delivery. The third Key Result Area (KRA), Government digital transformation, enhances the government digital transformation agenda, focusing on foundational initiatives that support a modern, inclusive, and secure digital ecosystem. The Expansion of the Somali ID System, Establishment of a Security Operations Centre (SOC), and One-Stop Shop e-Government System are three critical initiatives that illustrate sectoral development across national security, citizen accessibility, and service efficiency. Government digital transformation will streamline service delivery, increase transparency, and foster economic opportunities through digital inclusion. By aligning public sector operations with international best practices and leveraging technology, Somalia aims to create a sustainable governance model that supports socio-economic development, reduces inequalities, and fosters resilience. The long-term impact of these reforms will be a stable, transparent, and accountable public sector that restores public trust and drives national development. Somalia will emerge as a governance leader in the region, setting benchmarks for institutional resilience and citizen engagement. Enhanced public sector performance will attract investment, spur economic growth, and strengthen role on the global stage. The success of these hinges on several assumptions: sustained political commitment, active citizen participation, and continued international support. Robust collaboration among federal and state governments is critical to ensure coherence in implementing reforms. However, risks such as resource constraints, systemic resistance to change, and inadequate capacity may impede progress. Addressing these risks through strategic partnerships, targeted investments, and adaptive planning is crucial to achieving the reform goals. public sector reform agenda represents a decisive step toward transforming governance, rebuilding trust, and enhancing service delivery. By focusing on professionalising the civil service, strengthening institutional accountability, and embracing digital transformation, this Theory of Change provides a roadmap to achieving sustainable governance. With strong political will and collective action, Somalia can turn its vision of an efficient, citizen-centred public sector into reality. 81 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 4.3. Key Result Areas Key Result Area 1: Improving Public Service and Civil Service Management Case for Change According to the Government Effectiveness Index, which assesses the perceptions related to: (i) the quality of public service, (ii) the civil service's independence from political pressures, (iii) the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and (iv) the government's commitment to these policies, Somalia stands at one of the lowest index score of (-2.03) in comparison with both the East African region and the global as well. These scores sharply contrast with significant gaps in its governance effectiveness. public sector struggles with inefficiencies, fragmented structures, and a lack of skilled personnel, limiting its ability to meet governance demands and deliver quality public services. These systemic challenges have eroded public trust and hindered institutional credibility. In addition, there has been a long-standing public confidence deficit due to lack of meritocracy of civil servants inclined to clan-based political power-sharing structure (the so-called 4.5 formula) that has led to the politicisation of the civil service employees. The public service and civil service management is constrained by outdated recruitment practices, a lack of training opportunities, and insufficient mechanisms for performance evaluation. Therefore, the government's prioritization for public service and civil servant reforms will ensure building capable public institutions that can deliver quality service to the public. -2.03) to These initiatives prioritise the modernisation of public institutions administration through organisational re-structuring and standardised HR business processes, including merit-based recruitment and performance evaluation systems. By fostering transparency and competency, the public sector will align with international standards, enhancing efficiency and accountability. Addressing skills gaps through tailored training programs is another critical focus. 82 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Strategic Objective: Professionalise the public service management and adhere to its values to improve government effectiveness from its current weak ( medium (-1.5) performance by 2029 Equipping civil servants with the necessary competencies will ensure a motivated and capable workforce driving governance and national development goals. The establishment of a civil service training institute and School of Government will institutionalise capacity-building efforts, creating a professional and skilled civil service. By addressing long-standing training deficits, this initiative will lay the foundation for sustainable public sector reform and improved service delivery, fostering public trust and advancing development agenda. Initiative 1. Organisational Restructuring & Modernisation of HR Business Processes This initiative aims to overhaul public service institutions administration by introducing standardised structures, merit-based recruitment, and performance evaluation systems. The focus is on creating a transparent and competency-driven HR framework to professionalise public sector operations and align them with international standards. Enhanced accountability and efficiency in public service delivery will lead to a more responsive government. The establishment of streamlined organisational processes is expected to improve institutional credibility and foster public trust in governance. Initiative 2. Civil Service Capacity Development Through Training Programs This initiative addresses the skills gaps within civil service by implementing customised training programs designed to equip employees with the competencies required for effective governance. It prioritises ongoing professional development and capacity-building efforts. The creation of a well-trained, motivated workforce will significantly enhance the quality-of-service delivery. This initiative aims to develop a civil service that is capable of meeting the demands of governance while driving national development goals. Initiative 3. Establishment of Facilities for a Civil Service Training Institute School of Government and National Civil Service Commission: This initiative seeks to establish a dedicated institution for training and developing civil servants, and effective management of civil service, fostering a culture of professionalism and lifelong learning. The institution Somalia School of Government will serve as the backbone for capacity-building efforts in the public sector management. The institution will produce a more skilled and professionalised civil service capable of delivering quality services governance. By addressing long-standing training deficits, this initiative will lay the foundation for sustainable capacity building in Somalia. To enable these institutions, they require infrastructure facilities for their effective operations. 83 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Key Result Area 2: Institutional Integrity and Accountability Case for Change Somalia's governance institutions face systemic challenges, including institutional fragility, weak enforcement mechanisms, pervasive corruption, weak oversight mechanisms, and ineffective communication frameworks, all of which erode public trust and hinder democratic progress. Strengthening institutional integrity and accountability is vital for fostering a transparent and ethical public sector that aligns with governance standards. public institutions lack the capacity to implement and sustain necessary reforms, with legal frameworks often outdated and insufficient to combat contemporary governance issues. Moreover, limited collaboration among integrity institutions, coupled with inadequate accountability mechanisms perpetuates a culture of impunity and erodes public trust. Strengthening governance structures and fostering a culture of transparency lie at the heart of efforts to restore institutional integrity. Thus, the government's efforts shall focus on empowering integrity institutions and establishing integrity and accountability mechanisms and to handle corruption cases, reducing impunity and fostering accountability. The priority focused on enhancing institutional integrity, accountability, and controls in public sector is critical. Strategic Objective: To enhance public sector integrity for better service delivery and increase the CPI score from 11 in 2023 to 25 by 2029 By enforcing transparency and building robust oversight mechanisms, it aims to restore public confidence in governance and promote ethical public service. Initiative 1. Establish Key Integrity Institutions and Secure their Independence This initiative focuses on empowering integrity institutions such as reinstating an anti-corruption commission, establishing anti-corruption courts/units and professional accountants to handle corruption cases. It also aims to enforce transparency and build robust oversight mechanisms within key governance institutions. Enhanced public trust in government institutions through reduced corruption and greater accountability. This initiative will also ensure compliance with governance standards and foster a culture of ethical public service. 84 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Initiative 2. Enhancing Citizen-Centred Governance Through Transparency and Accountability Somalia needs to initiate and implement citizen-centred and sound governance principles to build public trust, promote effective service delivery, and ensure a responsive approach. Improving this approach requires transparency and accountability across the nation, enhancing a citizen-centred governance model. Key objectives include increasing investigations into corruption cases that lead to judicial action, eliminating the culture of impunity, and ensuring adherence to audit reports and implementing their recommendations. Initiative 3. Strengthening The Capacity of Integrity Institutions And Promoting Professionalism Capacity development for integrity institutions will enable them to perform investigative, compliance, and accountability functions effectively. This is particularly important in public financial management, public property management, adherence to the law, and serving the best interests. Moreover, by prioritising high-quality training and cultivating a culture of integrity and responsibility, along with the necessary infrastructural support, these institutions will significantly improve their effectiveness in fulfilling their investigative, compliance, and accountability mandates. Key Result Area 3: Government Digital Transformation Case for Change The E-Government Development Index (EGDI), a key metric in the United Nations E- Government Survey, evaluates countries' e-government progress through three sub-components of (i) Online Service Index (OSI), which measures the quality and availability of government services online; (ii) Telecommunication Infrastructure Index (TII), assessing ICT infrastructure like internet and mobile networks, and (iii) Human Capital Index (HCI), which evaluates the population's ability to use digital services based on education and literacy levels. Somalia's EGDI score of 0.14677, ranking it 191 out of 192 countries, reflects severe challenges across all dimensions: limited online services, poor ICT infrastructure, and low human capital due to low literacy rates and limited education access. This underscores the urgent need for investment in digital infrastructure, education, and governance to improve Somalia's e-government capabilities and bridge the digital divide. 85 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Somalia faces challenges with fragmented government services, inefficiency, and limited public access. The e-Government One-Stop Shop aims to address these issues by unifying services into a single platform, streamlining processes, reducing bureaucracy, and enhancing citizen access and satisfaction. Additionally, the Somali National ID System, which currently serves citizens in Mogadishu, has limited geographic reach and lacks integration with essential government services, constraining its effectiveness. To complement these efforts, a Security Operations Centre (SOC) is critical for safeguarding Somalia's infrastructure against cyber threats, mitigating system vulnerabilities, and fostering digital trust. Together, these initiatives will strengthen cybersecurity, promote economic growth, and facilitate digital adoption, aligning Somalia with global standards for a more secure and efficient digital landscape. The E-Government One-Stop Shop, the Somali National ID System, and the SOC collectively focus on enhancing service delivery, expanding access, protecting critical infrastructure, and building a digitally secure and inclusive environment that supports Somalia's developmental and economic goals. Strategic Objective: To transform government services through digital processes, improving digital adoption by elevating EGDI from its current position of 0.14677 (14%) to 0.40 (40%) by 2029 Initiative 1. Development of e-Government One-Stop-Shop System The e-government One-Stop Shop System aims to centralise government services into a single, accessible digital platform. By reducing bureaucratic complexities, this initiative will streamline service delivery and improve citizen engagement with the public sector. Increased efficiency in accessing government services and improved public satisfaction with service delivery. This platform will also contribute to reducing administrative delays and enhancing transparency across public institutions. With implementation spearheaded by the relevant and respective government institutions. Initiative 2. Expansion of the Somali National ID System This initiative will provide every Somali citizen with a secure digital identity to facilitate access to essential public services. It also aims to strengthen national security and promote financial inclusion by creating a reliable citizen registry. The National ID system will enhance national planning, simplify access to government services, and foster digital inclusion. 86 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 This initiative is also expected to improve public sector efficiency and strengthen the overall governance infrastructure. With implementation spearheaded by the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA). Initiative 3. Establishment of a Security Operations Centre (SOC) The Security Operations Centre will focus on monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats to protect digital infrastructure. This initiative aims to bolster digital security and safeguard sensitive government data. Increased resilience against cyberattacks and improved digital trust in government operations. By securing critical infrastructure, the SOC will enable the Somali public sector to embrace digital transformation with confidence. 4.4. Enablers Successful public sector reform in Somalia relies on a set of critical enablers that address systemic challenges and promote the long-term sustainability of reform initiatives. These enablers cut across governance, institutional integrity, and digital transformation, providing essential support for modernising the public sector, enhancing accountability, and improving service delivery. These enablers can be grouped into three critical areas: leadership and governance, legal and regulatory frameworks, and resource and capacity development. Together, they create a strong foundation for advancing reforms in civil servant management, institutional integrity, and digital transformation. Leadership and Governance Political will and leadership commitment are the cornerstones of effective public sector reform. Strong leadership drives the implementation of reforms, mitigates resistance, and models transparency and accountability across institutions. Leaders play a pivotal role in fostering institutional independence and setting a clear tone for modernisation efforts, particularly in areas such as merit-based civil servant recruitment and anti-corruption measures. Leadership is also vital for steering transformative initiatives like the Somali National ID system, the centralised e-government platform, and the establishment of a Security Operations Centre (SOC). By championing these projects and prioritizing cybersecurity, leadership ensures that reforms are implemented with consistency and public trust. 87 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Legal and Regulatory Frameworks Comprehensive and updated legal frameworks are essential for supporting institutional independence, reducing politicisation, and ensuring accountability. Robust legal and regulatory systems underpin all reform efforts, including civil servant management, digital transformation, and anti-corruption measures. For example, modernising policies related to civil service recruitment and performance evaluation enhances professionalism and reduces vulnerabilities to political interference. Similarly, implementing data protection and privacy laws is crucial for building public trust in digital systems like the National ID and SOC. By aligning with international standards, Somalia can ensure compliance with global best practices, reinforcing the credibility and sustainability of reforms. Resource and Capacity Development Adequate resource allocation and capacity development are fundamental to enabling effective reform implementation. Investments in infrastructure, technology, and human capital are necessary to support initiatives across the public sector. For civil servant management, this includes re-establishing a dedicated training institute to address skill gaps and enhance professionalism, alongside implementing HR Management Information Systems (HRMIS) to streamline operations and automate performance management. Similarly, resource allocation for digital transformation ensures the development of robust IT infrastructure, enabling the delivery of e-government services and improving accessibility. Addressing resource gaps, such as funding, skilled personnel, and technology, is also critical for anti-corruption and governance reforms. Building public engagement mechanisms further empowers citizens to participate in governance, fostering transparency and accountability while strengthening institutional integrity. Transforming Governance for Effective Service Delivery: A Roadmap for Success Effective governance and accountability are the cornerstones of stability, development, and peacebuilding efforts. As the country continues its journey toward institutional reform, strengthening public sector management is essential for restoring public trust, improving service delivery, and fostering economic resilience. The National Transformation Plan (NTP I) provides a strategic blueprint to modernise the civil service, enhance institutional integrity, and leverage digital transformation to build a transparent and citizen-cantered governance system. 88 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Strengthening Public Service and Civil Service Management A well-functioning public sector requires a professional, capable, and motivated civil service. To achieve this, Somalia is prioritising civil service reforms that focus on merit-based recruitment, competency development, and performance-driven administration. The Government Training Institute will play a central role in equipping civil servants with the necessary skills to meet evolving governance demands. Additionally, the automation of human resource management systems will reduce inefficiencies and promote fairness in hiring and career progression. By investing in a professional and ethical civil service, Somalia aims to foster institutional stability and ensure government institutions effectively serve citizens. Enhancing Institutional Integrity and Accountability Institutional credibility depends on strong governance frameworks that uphold integrity, transparency, and accountability. Somalia is advancing anti-corruption efforts by empowering oversight bodies, strengthening enforcement mechanisms, and introducing whistle-blower protections to create a culture of ethical governance. reinstating an anti-corruption commission and anti-corruption court/unit will enhance legal enforcement, while digital monitoring tools will track public expenditures and service delivery outcomes. Capacity-building initiatives for government officials will further instil ethical leadership and accountability within public institutions. These measures are critical for reducing corruption, increasing public confidence, and ensuring the effective implementation of national priorities. Driving Government Digital Transformation Digital transformation is a game-changer in public sector reform agenda. The government is investing in e-governance systems, data-driven decision- making, and interoperability across ministries to improve efficiency and reduce bureaucratic bottlenecks. The establishment of a National Data Centre will streamline information management, support evidence-based policymaking, and enhance public sector responsiveness. Furthermore, expanding digital access will ensure inclusive service delivery, particularly benefiting marginalised communities in rural and remote areas. By harnessing technology, Somalia can build a more agile, transparent, and citizen-centric government. 89 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 172 Table 1: Roadmap to Success Challenges Initiatives Explanations Structural and Institutional Challenges.

UN SDGs Addressed Government Communication 5.1. Overview government communication efforts face significant challenges, including fragmented messaging, limited coordination among federal and member state entities, and a lack of public trust. The Government Communications Office (GCO), under the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism, established to unify and streamline communication outputs, remains underdeveloped, with resource and structural limitations further impeding progress. Media landscape analysis reveals inadequate coverage of government achievements, contributing to public disengagement and mistrust. Al strategic and coherent narratives exacerbate this issue by effectively leveraging communication to influence communities. Somalia continues to have one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, with low digital literacy posing a significant barrier to economic empowerment and resilience. As of 2023, Somalia had approximately 1.76 million internet users, representing an internet penetration rate of 9.8 percent. Additionally, the country is home to 1.95 million social media users, accounting for 10.9 percent of the total population. 91 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Given the growing influence of digital platforms and the increasing number of users engaging with online content, there is a pressing need to establish regulatory frameworks to manage and oversee the insights, reports, and content published on these platforms. Proper regulation is essential to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and ethical use of information while mitigating the risks of misinformation and harmful content. This will not only enhance digital resilience but also foster a more informed and empowered society. The operationalisation of 2020 Media Law remains incomplete, hindering effective media regulation. Furthermore, feedback mechanisms for public participation and grievance redressal are absent, preventing meaningful engagement. Traditional media, primarily radio, remains the dominant platform due to its accessibility in a country with high illiteracy rates. Urban areas have increasing access to television and social media, but rural and nomadic populations often rely on word-of-mouth communication. The lack of robust infrastructure and digital penetration limits widespread information dissemination. These gaps make combating misinformation and promoting accurate narratives critical for fostering public trust and enabling effective governance. The challenges outlined underscore the urgent need for National Communication Strategy, under the Minister of Information, Culture and Tourism to enhance coordination, strengthen governance communication capabilities, and rebuild public trust through accurate, timely, and inclusive messaging. By addressing these structural and operational deficits, Somalia aims to create a cohesive communication framework aligned with its development priorities. FIGURE 13: HOUSE CHART: KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATION 14 92 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 5.2. Theory of Change Effective communication is vital for fostering public trust, enhancing transparency, and bridging gaps between the Somali government and its citizens. Somalia faces persistent challenges, including fragmented messaging, weak inter-ministerial coordination, limited citizen engagement, and the pervasive threat of misinformation. Extremist narratives further exploit these vulnerabilities, undermining public trust and national cohesion. A reformed communication framework is essential to address these gaps, align stakeholders, and build an informed, engaged society that supports national stability and sustainable development. The Government Communication Office (GCO) will centralise and streamline communication across federal and state levels, ensuring unified messaging and improving public awareness. Capacity-building initiatives will equip government officials with the skills to manage misinformation, respond to crises, and disseminate accurate information effectively. Inter-ministerial collaboration platforms will foster alignment across government entities, while a legislative framework will institutionalise communication practices to enhance transparency, consistency, and public engagement. These measures will collectively strengthen public trust in governance, laying a foundation for cohesive policy implementation and national unity. Collaboration with non-state actors such as civil society organisations, the private sector, and media outlets is critical for amplifying outreach efforts and ensuring balanced narratives. Consultative meetings and public-private partnerships will foster responsible reporting and collective action on national challenges. Conflict-sensitive journalism training will enhance media professionalism, promote ethical reporting, and counter divisive narratives. Strengthening independent media platforms through training and resource support will empower local outlets to disseminate diverse perspectives, counter misinformation, and build resilience against propaganda. 93 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Citizen engagement is central to fostering an inclusive communication ecosystem. Public outreach campaigns will raise awareness of government achievements, promote civic participation, and counter extremist ideologies. Feedback mechanisms such as hotlines, online portals, and community consultations will provide citizens with avenues to voice their concerns, enhancing responsiveness and inclusivity in policymaking. Media literacy programs will equip citizens with critical thinking skills to navigate information responsibly, reducing susceptibility to misinformation and fostering trust in credible sources. This holistic approach through the NTP I will ensure that the MoICT can help foster transparency, trust, and national unity. By integrating communication reforms into governance, MoICT can counter misinformation, amplify accurate narratives, and build a cohesive society that supports sustainable development and stability. This transformative strategy positions communication as a cornerstone for national growth and resilience. 94 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 5.3. Key Result Areas Key Result Area 1: Public Communications Case for Change Effective government communication is critical for fostering public trust, countering misinformation, and ensuring cohesive governance in Somalia. Current challenges, such as fragmented messaging, limited coordination across government entities, and inadequate capacity for strategic communication, undermine transparency and public engagement. The lack of a centralised communication framework and legislative guidelines further exacerbates inefficiencies, leading to inconsistent information dissemination and reduced citizen trust in governance. To address these issues, reforming the legislative and institutional framework for Government Communication, the Operationalisation of the Government Communication Office (GCO) and the establishment of an inter-ministerial government communication committee is paramount in order to enhance and expand public communication, transparency and awareness.

Sustainable Economic Transformation O V E R A R C H I N G G O A L : Economic Growth, Increased Productivity and Investments Overview Somalia, which is situated in the horn of Africa, has a large informal economy that was shaped by market activities, employing 51% of the labour force15. The economy has undergone significant transformation in the last 4 decades- transitioning from government-controlled economy to a free market- oriented economic activity. Despite decades of upheavals and civil wars, the Somali economy has been resilient in some specific sectors such as agriculture, telecommunication and trade sectors. The economy is resource-based hosting an abundant natural potential in marine, agriculture, fishing and extractives resources- mainly oil and gas as shown. The economy has significant opportunities to upscale growth and development by strengthening productive sectors mainly crops and livestock. The sectors have a high value fishing resources of approximately 57 million livestock, significant arable land for crop production and sustainable marine resources enabling Somalia the ability to provide over 200,000 metric tonnes per annum. 15 Somalia Labour Force survey; 2019 98 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 The two main sectors driving Somalia's economy in terms of employment and growth are services and agriculture. Agriculture accounts for over 60% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), with the livestock subsector contributing 40% and 80% being from external earnings. economy has shown resilience and despite multiple challenges, achieved average growth rate of around 3% for the past 6 years, excluding 2020 where COVID-19 pandemic shut down global economy. According to the IMF and World Bank, economy is projected to grow at 3.7% in 2024, up from 2.8% in 202318, driven by the recovery of crops and livestock, an expected increase in remittance inflow, and improved national stability and security. Additionally, SNBS reported that in 2023, economic growth rate reached 4.2% as per change of GDP calculation method19. The increase, which is mostly the result of private-public consumption, financed by remittances and external grants from international accounts for 35% and 55.4% of the national GDP, respectively. FIGURE 14: SOMALIA RESOURCE ENVELOPE16 FIGURE 15: GDP VS GROWTH RATE 2023 -202417 99 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Inflation in Somalia stabilized in 202320, despite food prices have been volatile due to supply chain disruptions, global economic conditions, and recurrent droughts. The inflation was initially assumed to be at an average of 4.1% and now projected at 4.8% in 2024, implying the Government will need to spend more on common items in the coming months of the year. The external sector still has significant opportunities for Somalia economic growth, as there is a lower export base and productivity. The balance of payment is in deficit in a growing rate of 5,985.97 USD due ascending headway of import regime financed by the remittance. FIGURE 16: INFLATION RATE 21 FIGURE 17: BALANCE OF PAYMENT 2019-202322 100 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 One of the fundamental challenges of macro-economic stability includes unemployment which has a profound impact on socio-economic development. The unemployment rate in Somalia saw no significant changes since 2012 and remained at average of 19.03 percent. In year, 2023 marked the second consecutive decline of the unemployment rate. The FGS intention to improve fiscal space mainly emphasizes revenue mobilisation and expenditure managements critically performed significant progress. The domestic revenue collections have increased 25% in 202325, the government doubled its efforts to mobilise domestic resources through expanding tax bases to informal sectors and conducts significant reforms as shown in 2023 fiscal report by the finance ministry. In addition to that donor support has played significant role in the budget equilibrium, with external grants representing a substantial portion, despite the country aims to reduce reliance on donor funding through increasing domestic revenue to meet its needs for operational spending in the medium term of fiscal planning. FIGURE 18: UNEMPLOYMENT RATES 2012 -202224 FIGURE 19: REVENUE VS EXPENDITURE 2018-202326 101 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 Chapter 6: Productive Sector 184 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 O B J E C T I V E : Driving Productive Growth and Economic Stability UN SDGs Addressed: 6.1. Overview The productive sector is a critical component of Somalia’s economy, which is composed of primary economic sectors and activities driven by agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and relevant emerging sectors like renewable energy, extractive industries, manufacturing, and services like tourism. These sectors are key drivers of the economy and significantly contribute to national GDP and employment generation. Despite the existing challenges of insecurity, limited infrastructure, and the devastating impact of climate change, the sector has shown resilience by providing a source of livelihood and employment for a significant number of the Somali population. Beyond that, the sector holds significant potential for growth and transforming the economy toward prosperity. Somalia’s economy depends on agriculture and livestock, which generates over 80% of export revenue, significantly contributing towards job creation and food security and covering over 70% of the national GDP contribution27. Strengthens food security through agricultural investments. Supports value addition and market linkages in agriculture and fisheries. Encourages sustainable farming and livestock management. 27 NEC Economic report 2023 102 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 185 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The country has an agricultural advantage of more than 8.9 million hectares of fertile land and two principal rivers (Shabelle and Jubba), which can provide adequate water resources consistently. Furthermore, Somalia’s rich soils, particularly in the riverine zones, could allow for the year-round cultivation of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, and legumes among other agricultural products. Despite years of political instability, effects of climate change over time and limited infrastructure, farming is improving in this vast agricultural region of south and central Somalia with minor focus in northern regions. In addition to that, other key important high value products include forestry products such as gums and resins, lemons and sesame which are all creating plenty of opportunities in this sector. Due to the abundance of riverine water, irrigation technologies and the fertile soils, agricultural production has become of primary focus in the southern region of Somalia28. 28 CBS report 2024 P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 6 103 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 186 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The South and Central regions yielded the highest crop production with the four top major crops of maize, cowpea, sorghum and sesame giving a combined gross production value of US$99mil since they had the most fertile land and plenty of riverine water for irrigation29. 29 FAO report 2022 30 CBS Livestock Policy Brief 2023 31 CBS 2024, World bank 2024 32 FAO, AFDB 2018, reports The major agricultural crops in Somalia are sorghum, maize, cowpeas and sesame, which dominates the plantation area of southern-central regions of the country. Somalia's livestock has been at the centre of economic performance, contributing significantly to gross national income by 80% of external earnings31. With an extensive structural reform, the sub-sector is anticipated to grow rapidly with increased government and donor support. The Livestock and Agriculture sector has been the source of livelihood for the Somali population and plays a crucial role in the country’s economic activities by directly or indirectly engaging around 50-60% of Somalia’s population. This includes a wide range of participants, such as traders, butchers, transporters, and input suppliers who provide crucial resources like feed and veterinary services32. Livestock and its products are the major contributors to Somalia’s economy and contribute to 45% of GDP in 2023 & employ the majority of Somalia’s population. The majority of Somalia’s livestock population is concentrated in the southern regions, particularly near the Juba and Shabelle river valleys, where agro-pastoral systems are prevalent.

Somalia has one of the longest coastlines of 3,333 km in mainland Africa and 1.2 million km2 of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with enormous fishing potential. Recent surveys of Somali waters show significant stocks along the coast, which is some of the richest fishing grounds in the region. The Somali marine ecosystem is one of the largest upwelling systems in the world, which hosts monsoon-generated upwelling that spreads cold, nutrient-rich waters along the northeast coast in Puntland, primarily between Ras Asir and Ras Mabber, from May to August35. These areas of upwelling are often associated with high levels of primary productivity and rich biomass, offering significant economic value in fisheries. The fishing days of artisanal fisheries vary between 220 and 240 days per year, while offshore fishing vessels have been forced to change their fishing grounds, fishing gear, or target species36.

The majority of fishermen in Somalia focus on traditional subsistence fishing activities, equipped with relatively small boats, while utilising manual equipment. In 2019, global fish consumption was 20.5 kg per capita, increasing from 14.4 kg in 2000. In Somalia, however, fish consumption is still low, with the last available data suggesting that 3.3 kg of fish is consumed per capita indicating a major opportunity for growth for domestic consumption in the country39. Furthermore, a recent report from the Somalia Ministry of Fisheries and Blue Economy reveals that the annual catch of fish in Somalia by using traditional artisanal vessel methods is estimated at approximately 6,000 tonnes, while the illegal foreign vessels catch is estimated to be 13,000 tonnes per annum, which represents less than 10% of the country's total annual fish harvest, which is estimated to be 200,000 tonnes per annum41.

Case for Change Agriculture The major agricultural crops in Somalia are sorghum, maize, cowpeas, and sesame, which dominate the plantation area of the southern-central regions of the country. A desk review mapping of these four major crops and a comparison with EAC show that Somalia is the 6th largest sorghum producer in EAC, with over 52% of the country’s production cantered in the Bay region. Despite allocating the largest plantation area to sorghum, Somalia’s yield per hectare is the lowest in the region, which accounts for 451 per ha. When looking at regional production capacity, the Bay region has the most producers (52% of Somalia's sorghum production capacity). The Lower Shabelle region and Lower Juba come in second and third, producing 29% and 19% of Somalia's total maize production, respectively. Furthermore, Somalia is the 7th largest maize producer in the East African Community, despite having the most agricultural land in EAC with the 2nd lowest maize yield per hectare. Maize yield is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, which lose 783 kg of yield per hectare. With regional production capacity, Lower Shabelle is the leading region in the country, taking 51% of maize production in Somalia followed by Bay regions which have low production capacity of 18% total maize production in Somalia. Despite having the most agricultural land in the East African Community (EAC), Somalia ranks among the lowest producers of sesame seeds due to the dominance of subsistence crop production by small farm holders, which accounts for 80% of the agricultural output in the southern regions of the country. Among the regional production capacities, Lower Shabelle is the leading sesame producer across southern regions, having 36% of total production in Somalia, followed by the Bay region, which produces 30% of the total sesame production in Somalia. Several critical issues hinder Somalia's agricultural productivity including climate change impact, poor infrastructure and a lack of processing and storage facilities estimate post-harvest losses at 40%. Farmers face high operational costs and limited access to fertilisers, financing, and mechanisation, which prevent them from adopting modern practices. Weak governance and regulatory gaps exacerbate these challenges, pushing many farmers toward subsistence farming instead of commercial-scale operations.

While 44.1 million hectares of land are allocated for agriculture, only 1.1 million hectares (2%) are classified as arable. Frequent natural disasters, including droughts, erratic rainfall, and desertification, exacerbate the sector’s challenges, resulting in low yields and reduced livestock productivity. Although Somalia has one of the largest agricultural areas relative to total land area in East Africa—at 70.3%— arid conditions and limited freshwater resources severely restrict arable land to only 2% of the total (approximately 1.1 million hectares). 42 FAO 2022 43 FAO 2024 44 PESS Report 2013, SNBS Similarly, the availability of arable land has not increased in line with population growth, placing pressure on food production in Somalia, which is significantly below regional standards. Somalia’s population has seen a growth of 2.8% per annum44. Conversely, the amount of arable land has grown 0.05% per annum, leading to a potential scarcity of arable land.

Gulf countries overtake export destinations of Somalia’s livestock—particularly UAE and Oman, which are the top two countries that host significant heads of livestock valued at approximately 439 million, followed by Saudi Arabia at 138 million. The sharp increase in livestock exports in 2023 coincides with the lifting of export bans, improved weather conditions, and increased demand from export markets, as illustrated in the figure above. Livestock and its products are the major contributors to Somalia’s economy and contribute to 45% of GDP in 2023 & employ most of the Somali population.

Rangeland, covering over 53% of Somalia, provides natural pastures with grass, herbs, shrubs, and sparse trees. Animal mortality due to the latest severe drought in 2016/2017, estimated at 6.4 million heads, contributed to bringing the total animal population in the country down to less than 49 million heads in 201749. The current estimated livestock population is 57,000,000, indicating a significant goat and sheep population which stood at 30.9 million and 13.6 million heads, respectively, followed by camels at 6.6 million50. Somalia’s agriculture sector struggles with inadequate inputs, outdated equipment, and poor infrastructure, severely limiting productivity and modernisation. These deficiencies undermine food security, hinder economic growth, and weaken the sector’s resilience. Addressing these gaps is essential to unlocking its potential, ensuring sustainability, and driving progress for Somalia’s agricultural economy and livelihoods. Despite these challenges, Somalia’s agriculture and livestock sectors hold substantial untapped potential. By addressing the structural challenges and boosting production capacities, these sectors could significantly drive economic growth and enhance food security. Key interventions include investing in high-value crops, introducing modern irrigation systems, and mechanising farming practices to increase productivity. Developing processing plants, storage facilities, and transportation infrastructure is also critical for strengthening the food value chain and reducing post-harvest losses. The strategic focus will also include enhancing investments on smart agricultural practises and resilient infrastructure by promoting technology and innovation to strengthen climate change adaptation systems that supports vulnerable communities across all sectors. The key enablers will also be the key game changing priorities such as improving water management systems in agriculture, strengthening crop quality and transition to clean energy such as solar and wind power to adapt climate change impacts across agricultural areas. 49 LSDS 2020 50 LSDS 2020 P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 6 110 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 193 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Fisheries Somalia has the longest coastline of 3,333 km in mainland Africa and 1.2 million km2 of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with enormous fishing potential. Recent surveys of Somali waters show significant stocks along the coast, which is some of the richest fishing grounds in the region. With its vast marine resources, Somalia’s fisheries sector has the potential to serve as a transformative catalyst for economic growth and resilience. By addressing existing challenges and gaps, the sector can significantly boost production, generate employment opportunities, enhance food security, and establish Somalia as a competitive force in the global seafood industry. Despite Somalia’s natural advantages, the sector makes up only 2% of Somalia’s GDP and employs just 2% of the population. Annual fish production is estimated at approximately 120,000 metric tons, a fraction of its true potential of 340,000 to 420,000 metric tons. Artisanal and subsistence fishing dominate the industry, relying on small-scale traditional boats and rudimentary equipment. While the country exports products such as tuna, crustaceans, and mollusks, these exports generate just USD 15 million annually—a small figure compared to the sector’s possibilities. A primary focus must be on infrastructure investments to drive sectoral growth. Establishing modern landing sites, cold chain systems, and processing facilities would not only minimise post-harvest losses but also enhance the quality of fish products. 51 World Bank, SATG, MFBE P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 6 FIGURE 28: PEER BENCHMARKING FOR TOTAL FISHERIES PRODUCTION AND GDP CONTRIBUTION51 111 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 194 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Secondly, addressing governance and regulatory gaps is crucial for the sustainable development of Somalia’s fisheries sector. Weak enforcement mechanisms have left Somali waters highly vulnerable to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Strengthening governance frameworks at both federal and state levels is essential to promote sustainable resource management. Measures such as implementing stricter licensing systems, improving patrol capabilities, and collaborating with international partners to monitor fishing activities in Somali waters will be critical. These actions will help curb illegal practices, preserve fish stocks for local use, and ensure that revenues generated by foreign fleets are reinvested into Somalia’s economy. Building local capacity is another vital area of focus. providing Somali fishers with modern tools and targeted training will enhance their ability to access offshore, high-value fish stocks. A 2020 UNIDO survey revealed that 97% of Somali fishermen relied on manual methods and basic equipment, with handlines (63%) and trawling (34%) being the predominant techniques. Expanding access to financing for fishers and small enterprises is equally important, as it would allow investments in advanced vessels and equipment. These advancements would empower Somali fishers to better preserve, process, and export their catch, meeting international standards and securing higher market prices. Moreover, streamlined supply chains would improve domestic fish availability, contributing to better nutrition for local communities. 52 Consultation Workshop Questionnaire updated by FAO Consultant, Kulmiye A.J.

Engaging private investors and businesses creates opportunities for capital investment, technology transfer, and market expansion. Collaboration with private sector actors can help integrate the fisheries industry into global value chains while ensuring that local communities benefit from sectoral growth. Public-private partnerships can further drive advancements in infrastructure development, governance, and innovation, creating a robust foundation for the industry’s development. At the community level, the development of the fisheries sector has the potential to improve livelihoods and build resilience. Empowering coastal communities with better access to resources and markets could lift thousands of households out of poverty, creating sustainable income opportunities. Additionally, an organised fisheries industry would reduce reliance on subsistence activities, stabilising vulnerable communities and fostering economic independence. This would enhance the productivity and competitiveness of Somali fishers, reducing their reliance on outdated methods and enabling them to compete effectively with foreign fleets. 53 UNIDO (2020) P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 6 FIGURE 30: TYPE OF BOATS AND TOOLS USED BY SOMALI FISHERMEN53 113 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 196 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Tourism Given the unique cultural heritages, coastal landscape, and historical sites, the tourism sector in Somalia hosts potential opportunities for economic growth. However, the sector faces significant challenges related to security, environment and infrastructure deficiency, which has constrained its development. Somalia’s tourism sector has once prospered, leveraging its rich cultural heritage, diverse ecosystems, and unparalleled coastline to attract visitors worldwide. Tourism was instrumental in positioning Somalia as a key destination in the region. However, decades of civil conflict and political instability devastated the sector, leaving it largely undeveloped for over two decades. Despite these challenges, Somalia is at a pivotal moment in its recovery. With strategic investments and government initiatives like the 2019 National Tourism Policy and the 2023 Investments and Investors Protection Law, the sector is poised for revitalisation. The Somali diaspora and local entrepreneurs have already begun investing in hospitality infrastructure and services.

EPP 3: Seed Production and Processing Limited access to high-quality seeds in Somalia significantly hampers agricultural productivity, crop resilience, and the growth of high-value crops. Farmers often rely on low-yield, disease-prone seeds, which negatively impact yields and reduce their ability to withstand pests and climate shocks. This lack of improved seeds undermines food security; as local production struggles to meet demand. Furthermore, it stifles economic development by limiting opportunities for marketable, high-value crops. Expanding access to quality seeds is essential to boosting yields, resilience, and sustainable agricultural growth in Somalia. By 2029, this EPP aims to achieve a 68% increase in crop production yield and a total seed unit sale of 250 metric tons (MT).

With livestock populations including camels, cattle, and sheep or goats requiring 2,550 tonnes, 10,900 tonnes, and 3,360 tonnes of feed daily, respectively, there is significant demand for high-quality animal feed. Cultivating and processing nutritious fodder enhances livestock productivity, ensuring better health and higher yields of milk, meat, and other products. This not only supports food security but also strengthens economic stability, as livestock contributes significantly to Somalia's GDP. These initiatives focus on developing local fodder production systems, reducing reliance on imported feed, and ensuring consistent supply throughout the year. By prioritising sustainable feed cultivation and processing, such projects empower Somali farmers and herders, fostering a more resilient livestock sector. Investments in fodder infrastructure and technology are essential for building a robust, self-reliant agricultural economy in Somalia. By 2029, this EPP aims to achieve a total annual fodder yield of 270 tonnes. EPP 5: Live Animals and Meat Processing Live animals and meat processing boost export revenues, create employment opportunities, and enhance the domestic food supply, reducing reliance on imported meat products. This initiative focuses on improving infrastructure, ensuring animal health, and meeting international export standards. By targeting high-demand markets such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, and Egypt, this EPP aims to establish modern quarantine facilities, upgrade logistics systems, and expand processing capabilities. The design of these efforts is to enhance local production, boost global market competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth in Somalia's agriculture and livestock sectors. By 2029, this EPP aims to achieve a total annual animal export of 921,300. EPP 6: Dairy Production & Value-added Dairy Products Dairy production and value-added products are essential for Somalia, providing a steady income for pastoralists, improving food security with nutritious local products, and unlocking opportunities in export markets. By fostering a robust dairy sector, Somalia can strengthen rural livelihoods and reduce dependency on imported dairy products. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 6 123 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 206 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 EPP 6 focuses on transforming dairy industry into a sustainable and scalable economic driver.

EPP 9: High Value Crop Production and Processing high-value crop production has significant untapped potential but is hindered by multiple challenges. Below-average yields place Somalia behind its East African neighbours, while the country struggles to capitalise on high-potential crops like sunflower, sesame, and spices. By 2029, this EPP aims to achieve an annual production of 160 tonnes. EPP 10: Fruits and Vegetable Production By 2029, this EPP aims to achieve an annual production of 215 tonnes. Enablers The above-mentioned EPPs will be run by the private sector. To make sure they succeed, MoAI and MoLFR will focus on key enablers that will have the needed impact and help the private sector. These are: Water Access and Irrigation Infrastructure Water infrastructure projects are essential to tackling challenges of water scarcity, food insecurity, and climate vulnerability. Rainfall in Somalia is highly unpredictable, leaving farmers and herders struggling with water shortages during droughts and flooding during heavy rains. Groundwater resources, already stretched thin, are being depleted due to over-extraction, poor management, and the growing impacts of climate change, threatening the sustainability of irrigation. Additionally, unsustainable farming practices, deforestation, and overgrazing have degraded the land, reducing its ability to retain water and making irrigation efforts less effective. There are six projects collectively aimed at enhancing Somalia's agricultural productivity, water access, and resilience to climate challenges.

Integrated Marketplaces This enabler focuses on establishing two integrated marketplaces in Afgoye and Balad, spanning 1 square kilometre each. These marketplaces aim to directly connect producers with buyers, removing intermediaries. The initiative addresses significant post-harvest losses of 65-80% for fruits and vegetables and 45-55% for cereals and legumes, with at least 25% of these losses occurring during transit. It highlights the importance of sustainable infrastructure to minimise these losses. Research, Extension, Pest Management & Regulatory Services (REPR) The initiative focuses on building research hubs and laboratories to provide innovative, region-specific solutions while also developing eco-friendly pest management systems and training experts to align research with national policies. Extension services will include the construction of headquarters and regional facilities, fully equipped with tools, machinery, and operational training halls, such as farmer field schools, to support capacity building. Additionally, the construction of the Somali Agricultural Regulatory Inspection Services (SARIS) headquarters, plant health, and fertiliser laboratories will strengthen regulatory and inspection services. Inspection facilities at key entry points will be developed in phases, with necessary equipment, office furniture, and vehicles procured to ensure operational efficiency. Key Result Area 2: Maximise the Potential of Fisheries Given that Somalia claims the longest coast in Africa and a diverse range of marine species, fishing is another promising but underutilised economic sector. The sector plays a critical role in achieving inclusive economic growth, food security, and poverty reduction by withstanding the lives of a significant number of coastal societies in Somalia as a source of livelihood and job creation. Even though the fishing industry doesn't add much to the GDP and faces many problems, the government is determined to make sure it stays strong by putting in place strong plans and actions that will help the sector continue to perform well in the national economy.

Strategic Objective 1: Increase Catch Productivity from 120,000mt to 240,000mt by 2029 A multifaceted strategy is required to significantly increase Somalia's fish catch productivity from 120,000 metric tonnes (MT) to 240,000 MT. This would entail enhancing fishing operations' sustainability and effectiveness, growing fisheries infrastructure, refining fishing methods, and making sure marine resources are managed effectively. The government will prioritise the following key strategic initiatives: ! Improve the infrastructure of ports and landing sites by investing in fishing jetties across selected coastal areas. ! Establish fishing fleets and strengthen fishing catch technologies by promoting sustainable fishing gear to increase catch efficiency. ! Introduce new modern boats for sustainable fishing practices. ! Increase fish production scale by promoting sustainable fish catch practices and support coastal communities to have alternative fishing sources like mariculture to enhance sustainable aquaculture fishing practices. ! Invest in modern cold storage facilities and small ice factories to strengthen production capacities and reduce fishing spoilage and environmental impact. Strategic Objective 2: Increased Household Fish Consumption: From 3 kg/year (<1%) to 5 kg by 2029 It is estimated that the current average per capita fish consumption in Somalia is in between 2.4 - 3.3 kilograms which represents less than 1% of the population's total protein intake.59 This is far lower than the national average and has enormous untapped potential to improve the country's public health, food security, and nutrition.

This private project will focus on enhancing catch capacity through supplying modern equipment, strengthening cooperative associates for resource access and investment, technology adaptation, improved harvest handling, and post-harvest handling to reduce wastage. The project impact is expected to bring an additional annual catch of 23,817 (MT) and additional job creation of 2,430. This EPP aims for an additional annual catch of 28,441 MT and to create 4,762 jobs by 2029. EPP 2: Vertical Integration Somalia’s fisheries post-harvest losses at 30-40% are significantly due to limited cold storage, inadequate processing facilities, and poor transportation infrastructure. Reducing post-harvest waste in Somalia’s fisheries involves investment in cold storage facilities, improved transport infrastructure, and promotion of value-added fish products. Post-private sector engagements, the following projects were identified as areas of government and private sector collaboration. The focus was on supporting private sector investments in facilities for production and cold storage facilities expansion, cold chain development, and processing plants. This EPP aims for an additional annual marketable catch of 137,261 MT as a result of reduced post-harvest losses on vessels at the catch and during processing at the landing site stage and creation of 18,581 jobs. 2. Exploring Aquaculture / Mariculture The focus area covering EPP 3 looks at establishing the regulatory environment and exploring the potential of aquaculture and agriculture in Somalia. EPP 3: Aquaculture Farming This proposed aquaculture project is also a private-led initiative costing approximately 1.23 million aimed at strengthening sustainable fishing practices by focusing on aquaculture and mariculture fishing, including hatchery and nursery practices. The two pilot projects aim to establish essential facilities across the aquaculture value chain and ensure manpower availability through training and courses. The project impact is expected to result in an additional 10 MT of annual production (MT) and the creation of an additional 267 jobs.

Developing Value-Added Capabilities The focus area covering EPP 4 aims to enhance value addition through downstream processing. These Private sector players are interested in expanding their offering for exports and value adding beyond whole fresh and frozen fish, focusing on exports and value-added products. Additionally, processing and value addition would greatly benefit the domestic market by enhancing local consumption. Given the high nutritional value of fish, this would contribute to improved food and nutrition security. EPP 4: Downstream Processing Down processing projects are also private-led initiatives costing approximately 98.8 million aimed at reducing post-harvest waste in Somalia’s fisheries and also producing value-added products to maximize the economic potential of the fishing sector. The project impact is expected to bring additional annual production of 146,732 (MT) with additional job creation of 5,630. Enablers Elevating the fisheries sector will require significant commitment from MFBE supported by FMS, who will spearhead the development of key enablers. These will address challenges seen by the private sector through infrastructure development, creating an enabling environment, and increased monitoring capacity. Fisheries Processing Hubs The Secure Economic Zones (SEZ) is targeted to be operational by 2027, and each hub will span 100-150 hectares and cater to 3-5 fish-exporting companies alongside 100-150 informal processor-traders. With an expected increase in annual production by 6,500 metric tonnes and USD 31 million in value by 2029, the hubs are projected to generate over 620 jobs and drive a 40% export growth. Project Badmaal—Infrastructure for Fishing Communities Project Badmaal focuses on addressing critical infrastructure gaps within Somalia’s coastal fishing communities to enhance market access, reduce energy costs, and improve operational efficiency. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 6 134 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 217 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Following a multi-phase site selection process, we have identified ten priority sites across Puntland, Galmudug, Hirshabelle, South West, and Jubbaland for targeted infrastructure investment. This initiative aims to improve fish handling capacity, cold storage, and access to clean water while fostering greater economic productivity and resilience for 1,970 fishers and their families. Fisheries Data Collection & Ocean Observation: The fisheries sector will contribute to broader ocean science initiatives by integrating oceanographic sensors into fishing vessels and establishing community-based monitoring programs. This will support climate resilience, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable resource use. The initiative is expected to increase community-level catch productivity and expand market access, creating long-term benefits for fishing communities across Somalia. Budgeted at USD 55 million, the project spans from 2024 to 2030, with funding sourced from the World Bank and PROBLUE. By 2029, Project Badmaal is targeted to improve 12 communities in Somalia and achieve post-harvest loss reduction from 30% to 15%. Construction of new fishing ports The proposed construction of new fishing ports aims to enhance Somalia's fisheries infrastructure and address the current challenges faced by the sector. This project identifies Mogadishu, Berbera, and Kismayo as priority sites for new port development, with a focus on creating dedicated fishing infrastructure. Enhanced Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) Systems The National Fisheries Strategy focuses on the development of an Enhanced Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) System to address these challenges. The initiative aims to deploy modern technologies and strengthen governance frameworks to protect marine resources, ensure sustainability, and foster economic growth. With an estimated budget of USD 5.86 million, funded through contributions from the World Bank and other stakeholders, the project is set to begin in 2024 and conclude by 2030. This initiative will play a crucial role in reducing IUU activities, improving livelihoods, and aligning the fisheries sector with sustainable economic goals. By 2029, MFBE intends to detain 30 illegal fishing vessels through its increased capabilities and capacity.

Overview Somalia's energy sector has progressed in the last 3 decades with several key developments. During the civil war, the energy sources, primarily the oil and gas sector, were largely abandoned after the civil war, and state-owned electricity infrastructures collapsed, which left empty and totally scattered the formal energy system of Somalia60. This has resulted in heavy reliance on fuel wood and charcoal for energy, covering up to 80-90% of energy consumption in 2000-201061. The disintegration of state-controlled electricity infrastructure left both urban and rural populations without reliable access to energy. In the 2000s, private sector entities started to fill the gap by establishing isolated power networks in urban areas. However, these networks were small-scale and fragmented, unable to meet the growing energy demands of the population. In recent years, legislative advancements, including the drafting of the Petroleum Law and the establishment of the Somalia Petroleum Authority, have signalled renewed efforts to rebuild the sector and lay a foundation for its recovery. Expands renewable energy investments. Strengthens extractive industries through sustainable practices. 60 Somalia Power Master Plan 2020 61 World bank report 2020 140 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 36: SOMALIA’S ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE62 223 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 62 SNTP Lab Analysis 63 Ember, Energy Institute—Statistical Review of World Energy P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 Somalia’s current energy infrastructure remains inefficient and heavily reliant on imported diesel for electricity generation. Diesel-fired power plants dominate the energy mix, supplemented by emerging renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Energy distribution systems primarily consist of mini- grids and standalone setups, serving urban populations while rural areas remain largely underserved. However, outdated infrastructure constrains the sector, resulting in significant energy losses during transmission and distribution. The reliance on imported diesel further inflates electricity costs, making access to energy prohibitively expensive for many households. Fragmented networks and inefficiencies also hinder the adoption and scaling of renewable energy technologies, leaving large portions of the population without affordable and reliable electricity. FIGURE 37: ELECTRICITY GENERATION(TWH) AND PER CAPITA (KWH)63 141 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 224 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Somalia’s energy generation capacity lags significantly behind its regional peers, with a widening gap between supply and growing demand. In 2022, the country generated only 0.4 kWh of electricity, with a CAGR of 0.9% over the past decade. By contrast, neighbouring countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya have made substantial strides in expanding their capacity and increasing per capita electricity generation. Somalia’s limited generation capacity contributes to one of the lowest per capita electricity consumption rates in the region, highlighting the severe imbalance between demand and supply. This shortfall represents a major barrier to economic growth, as industries and urban populations require reliable, scalable energy supplies to drive development. Without strategic investments in generation capacity and transmission efficiency, Somalia risks falling further behind in meeting the energy needs of its growing population. 64 Somali Electricity Access Project 65 Somalia Integrated Household Budget Survey The disparity in energy access between urban and rural populations underscores broader inequities in Somalia’s energy landscape. Urban areas benefit from existing mini-grids and medium-voltage infrastructure, with 80.1% of residents having access to electricity. In contrast, only 39.4% of rural populations have access to power65. Nearly half of Somalia’s population resides within 10 kilometres of energy infrastructure, yet weak demand in rural areas discourages private sector investment. This urban-rural divide presents significant challenges to achieving equitable energy access across the country. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 FIGURE 38: ELECTRICITY ACCESS AND URBAN-RURAL DISPARITY INDEX64 142 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 39: ELECTRICITY TARIFF AND LOSSES FROM ELECTRICAL POWER67 225 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Somalia’s energy sector also continues to grapple with systemic inefficiencies that result in significant power losses66 and high operating costs. Estimated transmission and distribution losses stand at 40%, which is four times higher than the average for African countries. These inefficiencies stem from outdated infrastructure, including refurbished diesel generators, poorly maintained transmission systems, and the absence of advanced metering technologies. Frequent breakdowns and costly repairs further exacerbate the issue, inflating electricity prices and making power unaffordable for most households. The lack of proper monitoring systems also discourages energy-efficient practices, perpetuating high costs. These inefficiencies not only increase the financial burden on end-users but also deter private sector investment, hindering opportunities for growth and modernisation. 66 Shuraako Pioneering Progress 2 67 Global Petrol Prices, Shuraako Pioneering Progress 2 To further exacerbate, electricity tariffs in Somalia are among the highest globally. The reliance on imported diesel for power generation, combined with fragmented and inefficient distribution systems, drives up costs. These high tariffs disproportionately affect lower-income households and small businesses, limiting their ability to access and utilize electricity. Such challenges underscore the urgent need for reforms to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and expand access to affordable energy. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 143 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 226 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 However, Somalia is beginning to explore its untapped hydrocarbon resources, presenting an opportunity to address the country’s energy constraints. The government has signed 16 Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) covering onshore and offshore blocks, which have the potential to generate significant revenue through royalties, profit-sharing, and signing bonuses. Institutions such as the Somalia Petroleum Authority (SPA) and the SONOC are being strengthened to oversee and manage these developments effectively. These efforts signal a strategic shift toward building a resource-driven energy ecosystem that aligns with Somalia’s broader economic and development objectives. Harnessing domestic hydrocarbon resources, alongside efforts to modernize infrastructure and reduce inefficiencies, could lay the foundation for a more sustainable and inclusive energy future. 68 Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Reports Addressing these challenges and exploring untapped resources will require comprehensive and targeted Key Interventions. Investments in renewable energy, grid modernisation, and improved distribution systems are essential to reducing costs and expanding access, particularly in underserved rural areas. Tailored approaches, including rural electrification programs, incentives for private sector investment in rural grids, and policies to stimulate energy demand in sparsely populated regions will be critical. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 FIGURE 40: KEY BLOCKS68 144 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 227 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Bridging this divide is essential for promoting inclusive development and realising the full potential of Somalia’s energy sector. Strategic, coordinated efforts across public, private, and international stakeholders will be key to ensuring sustainable and equitable progress in the years ahead. Somalia is home to a diverse range of mineral resources, including significant deposits of bauxite, copper, feldspar, gold, iron ore, limestone, natural gas, and silica sand. However, the country’s mineral sector has historically remained underdeveloped due to prolonged civil unrest, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of updated geological surveys. According to the International Trade Centre, Somalia’s mineral exports declined by approximately 1.8% between 2009 and 2013, with niobium, tantalum, and vanadium ores accounting for 97% of total exports. Despite its resource wealth, the contribution of mineral exports to Somalia’s economy has remained minimal compared to other sectors, underscoring the untapped potential of the country's mineral resources. Risk-Mitigation Instruments and Legal Framework To enhance private sector participation in energy and extractive industries, risk- mitigation instruments such as guarantees, partial risk guarantees, and political risk insurance will be leveraged to de-risk investments. These measures provide financial security to investors against political, economic, and operational uncertainties, fostering greater confidence in Somalia’s energy market. The legal foundation for these risk-mitigation instruments is provided under Article 131 of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Act69, which allows the government to implement support measures, including guarantees, insurance, and financial undertakings, subject to approval and compliance with public finance regulations. By aligning with the PPP Act, this initiative ensures regulatory clarity and structured government support, ultimately enhancing investor confidence and project bankability in the sector. 69 Public Private Partnership Amendment to the Public Procurement, Concessions and Disposals Act 2024 P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 145 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 228 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 7.2 Case for Change Somalia’s energy sector holds significant potential to catalyse economic growth and improve living standards. Globally, energy consumption strongly correlates with GDP, and Somalia’s low per capita energy consumption places it at a disadvantage. Insufficient energy access hampers industrial productivity, restricts business efficiency, and limits access to quality education, healthcare, and communication for households. Additionally, over half of the population (61.9%) has access to electricity, largely due to mini-grid systems70. 70 SHBS 2023 report 71 World Bank 2022 Moreover, solar energy contributes only 11% of the total energy mix in Somalia. Fossil fuels, particularly diesel generators, still dominate, generating 88% of electricity. Addressing these gaps in energy availability is essential to fostering economic productivity, improving societal well-being, and advancing Somalia’s development goals. Somalia’s reliance on imported diesel for nearly 90% of electricity generation presents significant economic, environmental, and logistical challenges. The high cost of diesel-fired power plants, combined with fragmented distribution systems, has resulted in electricity tariffs that are among the highest globally, averaging USD 0.61 per kWh. In some regions, such as Galmudug and Puntland, tariffs exceed USD 1 per kWh—far higher than regional peers like Ethiopia, where electricity costs as little as USD 0.0 per kWh. These exorbitant costs disproportionately impact low- income households and small businesses, limiting their ability to access affordable energy and impeding economic growth. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 FIGURE 41: SHARE OF POWER GENERATION BY SOURCES71 146 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 229 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Heavy reliance on diesel generators also poses environmental and logistical challenges. Economically, fluctuating global fuel prices and foreign exchange constraints inflate electricity costs, straining household budgets and reducing business competitiveness. Logistically, transporting diesel to remote areas is costly and fraught with security risks. Environmentally, diesel generators contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution, impacting public health. Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind offers a clear path to addressing these challenges. With abundant natural resources, including an average of 3,100 hours of sunshine annually and wind speeds of 8 m/s, Somalia is well-positioned to harness clean energy solutions. Investing in renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar farms and wind power projects, can provide decentralized, stable, and sustainable energy for the population. Somalia’s abundant natural resources also offer a unique opportunity to transform its energy sector. The country’s proven reserves of over 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas and vast oil potential provide a foundation for energy independence and economic growth. Additionally, its renewable energy potential—including solar, wind, and hydropower—can diversify Somalia’s energy mix and reduce reliance on costly imports. Harnessing these resources through targeted investments will not only lower electricity costs but also create jobs, foster economic development, and position Somalia as a leader in renewable energy within the region. Somalia has begun taking promising steps toward transitioning to more sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions. Solar energy initiatives led by private sector companies such as BECO and Som-power have demonstrated success, reducing electricity tariffs by 50% in some areas. International donors, including the World Bank and UNDP, are also supporting renewable energy projects, showcasing the viability of renewables in reducing costs and increasing access. Building on these efforts will allow Somalia to reduce its dependence on diesel, lower energy costs, and achieve its 2030 vision for universal energy access. Expanding energy access and adopting sustainable energy solutions are crucial for driving industrial growth, job creation, and economic diversification in Somalia. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 147 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 230 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Key investments in energy infrastructure, renewable technologies, and grid modernisation will lay the foundation for this vision, while regulatory reforms can address inefficiencies and unlock the sector's full potential. A stable and reliable energy supply will also attract international investment, further enhancing Somalia’s resilience and economic development. Ultimately, these steps will help Somalia achieve its energy goals, improve social outcomes, and ensure long-term sustainability. Somalia’s energy ambitions are also closely linked to the extractive industries, where reliable energy access is essential for developing a more structured and sustainable mining sector. The mining landscape in Somalia is characterised by a significant number of inexperienced artisanal miners who are not following scientific or data-driven approaches to mineral prospecting. These miners often employ destructive methods, including the use of harmful chemicals, which pose severe risks to the environment. The lack of proper training and awareness further exacerbates the environmental damage, threatening local ecosystems and the sustainability of the mining sector. From the colonial times to the period between 1960 and 1991, Somalia’s mineral exploration was sporadic, and its contribution to GDP was fairly nominal. For instance, estimates from 1988 suggest that this sector contributed a mere 0.3% to the GDP. Currently, there is minimal small-scale mining activity, primarily artisanal in nature, which underscores the need to grow this sector given its significant economic potential. However, the available data suggests that the country is endowed with a number of mineral resources, including the following: Table 4: Mineral Resource Envelope 72 MOPMR 2024 P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 Mineral Resource Envelope Mineral Resources Metallic Tin, iron, copper, gold, platinum, molybdenum and lithium Gemstones Emerald, sapphire, ruby aquamarine, opal, garnet and beryl Industrial Gypsum, limestone, quartz, kaolin, bauxite, feldspar and silica sand Agro-minerals Phosphorites, bird guano deposit, apatites, sepiolite and salt Building materials Granite, marble, sandstone, crushed rocks and aggregates Energy minerals Uranium and coal72 148 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 231 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The deposits of the clay mineral sepiolite, or meerschaum, in south-central Somalia are among the largest known reserves in the world. The estimated value of these reserves is 120 million tons73. Critical minerals are a wide range of minerals and metals that are essential in clean energy technologies, typically including copper, chromium, cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, platinum group metals or zinc, rare earth elements, and other commodities74. Clean energy technologies, from wind turbines and solar panels to electric vehicles and battery storage, require a wide range of minerals and metals. Fundamental Challenges ! Political and security concerns: There have been limited large scale mining activities due to security risks posed by the activities of terror groups. ! Infrastructure: There has been little development of infrastructure to support larger-scale mining activities, such as enhanced road, rail, and port facilities. ! There is a lack of comprehensive geological mapping and adequate geoscience facilities. ! Lack of capacity and financing: there is limited local capacity building in terms of technical knowledge, exposure to technology and business management skill. ! Budgetary constraints: There are limited resources available to dedicate to the expansion and regulation of the sector. The government seeks to increase the mineral sector’s contribution to the GDP and job creation and alleviate poverty by integrating the mining industry with the rest of the economy. The key national result areas attempt to prioritise improvement of the mining industry through mapping and conducting geological surveys, establishing a mineral data room, and building a mineral laboratory. 73 UNIDO - Industrial Development and Prospects of Somalia 74 I.E.A flagship report 2023 P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 150 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 232 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 7.3.

Key Result Areas Several projects will be initiated as part of the NTP I across two key areas of focus: unlocking oil and gas potential and propelling energy efficiency and inclusivity and unlocking mining resource potential. By addressing inefficiencies, diversifying energy sources, and fostering inclusivity, the sector will power industries, improve livelihoods, and unlock the country’s economic potential. These efforts align with the broader vision of achieving energy independence and inclusion for all Somalis by 2030. 75 SNTP Lab Analysis Somalia’s energy transformation represents a decisive step toward sustainable development, economic resilience, and social equity. Through coordinated action and robust implementation, the energy sector will be a cornerstone of Somalia’s National Transformation Plan. The following initiatives are driven by USD 5.3 billion in private investments, and will create 14,981 employment opportunities, and contribute USD 1.45 billion to the national GDP by 2029. These are aimed at: ! Increased Energy Access and Inclusion: By 2029, targeted key interventions will increase electricity access to over 85% of urban populations and 50% of rural populations. ! Cost Reductions and Affordability: Transitioning to renewable energy sources and optimising fuel imports through consolidated procurement will lower electricity tariffs. It is also envisioned that electricity trade through the Eastern Africa Power pool (EAPP) cross-border trade would be one of the ways to address this challenge. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 152 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 234 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 ! Climate Impact: Somalia’s transition to renewables will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by millions of tonnes annually, supporting global climate commitments while improving air quality and public health. Key Result Area 1: Unlocking Oil and Gas Potential The oil and gas industry has the potential to be a significant force behind economic expansion and advancement, especially by drawing in foreign direct investment, generating employment, and increasing government revenue. The national key result areas include exploration of oil and gas resources to diversify the economy through progressive strategies. Strategic Objective: Invest in oil and gas exploration, extraction and production To achieve this objective, the government aims to strengthen resource exploration capacity through partnering with international investors for conducting comprehensive seismic surveys and mapping potential areas for oil and gas reserves. Initiatives ! Promoting FDI attraction for oil and gas exploration through launching a licensing campaign to streamline investment of oil and gas reserves. ! Scale up nationwide geological surveys and assessments of oil and gas exploration to unlock potential resources for economic diversification. ! The establishment of a national oil company, through the enhancement of capacity and administrative governance frameworks, aims to overtake the independent responsibilities of the petroleum sector and strengthen domestic fuel production systems. ! Streamline possible investment in key oil and gas infrastructure and facilities, including transportation pipelines and efficient port terminal facilities with processing facilities in the future. ! Establish oil and natural gas storage and distribution terminals. Key Interventions EPP 1: Unlocking National Petroleum Resources Currently, while International Oil Companies (IOCs) have initiated oil exploration in Somalia, local workforce participation remains minimal despite legal mandates for inclusion. The root issue lies in insufficient local expertise in upstream processes. Addressing this gap is crucial, as IOCs are increasingly open to collaborating with a skilled Somali workforce. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 153 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 43: ENHANCING SKILLS AND SPECIALIZATION OF SOMALI STUDENTS IN THE PETROLEUM SECTOR76 235 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 To realise its full potential in the petroleum sector, Somalia must bridge the gap between local workforce capabilities and the demands of upstream oil and gas operations. This project aims to equip 500 Somali nationals with critical upstream skills by 2029, supported by partnerships with IOCs, government bodies, and educational institutions. Three key pillars structure the program: training programs, apprenticeships, and scholarships. Training modules will focus on essential skills such as seismic surveying, drilling operations, and health, safety, and environmental (HSE) standards. Apprenticeships will provide on-the-job learning with IOCs, ensuring real- world exposure and job placement opportunities. Additionally, scholarships for 50 Somali students to study petroleum-related fields at international universities will enhance access to advanced expertise. By 2029, this initiative will establish a sustainable talent pipeline, reducing reliance on foreign experts and aligning with local content laws. IOCs will benefit from operational stability, cost efficiency, and strengthened public perception. The phased approach includes curriculum development, infrastructure upgrades, and impact assessments to ensure program success. This project is a cornerstone for Somalia’s energy future, fostering local expertise, creating jobs, and promoting inclusive economic growth in alignment with its long- term vision for energy independence. 76 SNTP Lab Analysis P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 154 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 44: SOMALIA GAS POTENTIAL77 236 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 EPP 2: Gas Processing Facilities Somalia's growing gas sector presents an opportunity to develop local capacity along the value chain. While extraction will initially rely on external expertise, building a local gas processing, storage, and distribution facility is essential. This project focuses on retaining value within Somalia, with long-term potential to involve locals in extraction activities. 77 SNTP I Lab Analysis Somalia’s natural gas sector has immense potential, particularly with the Afgooye Gas Project, which is set to extract over 13 million cubic feet of gas per day. However, without local processing, storage, and distribution capabilities, Somalia risks exporting its raw resources while importing refined products, losing significant economic value. This project focuses on establishing a local gas processing plant to enable the country to retain greater value in the energy sector. The proposed facility will include critical components such as inlet separation, acid gas removal, dehydration, and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery. These processes will ensure gas is refined and prepared for domestic use across various industries, including power generation, industrial manufacturing, and agriculture. A key output is ammonia-based fertilisers, which could reduce Somalia's reliance on imports, lower costs by 30%, and increase crop yields by 20-25%. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 155 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 237 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 By integrating local storage and distribution, the project will address Somalia’s dependency on imported fuels, reduce costs, and enable access to cleaner energy. Over time, the facility will enhance self-reliance, create jobs, and align with the broader vision of sustainable development. This initiative also lays the groundwork for Somali professionals to participate in gas extraction, fostering long-term expertise in the energy value chain. EPP 3: Optimising Reliable & Secure Trading Currently, Somalia’s fragmented fuel-importing system leads to higher purchase costs and frequent transactions, driving up prices for consumers. Consolidating importers under a single entity enables resource pooling and bulk purchasing, reducing costs and ensuring stability. This initiative aims to make fuel more affordable and accessible for Somalia's population. 78 SNTP I Lab Analysis P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 FIGURE 45: SONOC TRADING COMPOSITION78 156 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 238 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The consolidation of fuel imports in Somalia represents a transformative initiative aimed at stabilising prices and enhancing the overall efficiency of the fuel market. By pooling resources and unifying import strategies under a single entity, the project will leverage economies of scale, ensuring that Somalia can procure fuel at significantly reduced costs. This model draws inspiration from successful case studies, such as Nigeria, where consolidation reduced import costs by 15% and improved distribution efficiency, lowering losses from 20% to 5%. Somalia’s fragmented fuel import system currently results in high prices and frequent fluctuations, which are passed on to consumers. Through a PPP structure, the federal government and private stakeholders will share responsibilities, with a proposed 25-75 ownership split. The phased rollout begins with pilot resource pooling in Mogadishu, followed by the operationalisation of a digital trading platform and expanded storage and logistics capacity. By 2029, the initiative aims for nationwide implementation, ensuring stable supply chains and equitable fuel distribution across urban and rural areas. This project not only promises economic benefits but also aligns with Somalia’s broader goal of achieving energy security and affordability for its citizens. EPP 4: Rebuilding Domestic Fuel Production Somalia's dependence on fully refined fuel imports drives high costs and supply vulnerabilities. Establishing local fuel blending capabilities offers a strategic opportunity to reduce import reliance and manage costs. This project aims to set up initial blending infrastructure, enabling Somalia to produce blended fuels locally, with potential for future expansion to meet rising demand. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 157 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 239 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The establishment of a local fuel blending facility in Somalia offers a transformative approach to reducing reliance on fully refined fuel imports while optimising cost efficiency and supply chain control. Currently, Somalia imports fully refined products like petrol, diesel, and aviation fuel, which are not only costly but also limit flexibility in fuel grades tailored to specific local needs. By focusing on local blending, the country can import lower-cost base components such as low-octane fuel, low-sulphur diesel, and kerosene-based products to produce high-quality fuel locally. This project would make it possible to make customised fuel grades, such as Research Octane Number 88, 92, and 95 for cars, lubricants for industrial use, and improved jet fuels, so they could work with all of Somalia's different operating conditions. Local blending facilities also provide opportunities for greater supply security, price stabilisation, and reduced dependency on international refiners. Additionally, the facilities would pave the way for more efficient storage and handling infrastructure, reducing transportation costs and improving distribution networks. The phased implementation plan spans from 2025 to 2029, beginning with feasibility studies and workforce development, followed by infrastructure setup and achieving operational milestones. Learning from India’s ethanol blending journey, Somalia’s project emphasises streamlined regulatory frameworks, strong public- private partnerships, and scalable models to meet domestic demands effectively. 79 SNTP I Lab Analysis P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 FIGURE 46: BLENDING HIGH-LEVEL PROCESS79 157 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 240 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Key Result Area 2: Propelling Energy Efficiency and Inclusivity Key national result areas will include expanding energy access and infrastructure, reviving hydropower energy through exploring oil and gas, and developing the extractive sector through institutional reforms and investment. The way forward will outline goals and objectives with key strategies and Key Interventions aimed at transforming the energy sector. In line with the government agenda of transforming the economy, providing efficient energy supply is pivotal to emerging sectors like productive and private sector development. More even access to a mix of affordable energy sources for people who aren't served or who live in rural areas. Deep-dive strategic Key Interventions through bankable projects that aim to change the way people currently use energy in Somalia. Strategic Objective 1: Increase electricity access from 61.9% to 80% of Somalia’s population by investing in alternative sources of energy mix to expand electrification of rural areas by 2029 This is aimed at increasing the number of households with access to electricity, where the government is aimed at increasing energy supply for hard-to-reach areas and underserved populations in urban cities, including internally displaced locations outside in major capitals. Initiatives ! Expand solar power projects through investment in alternative sources of energy, like investing in solar electricity generation projects to produce off-grid electricity supply to be accessed by underserved households and rural areas. !

Through energy governance frameworks and PPP agreements, encourage and reward the private sector to invest in the energy sector, especially in energy infrastructure and facilities. ! Establishment of technical electric schools to foster technical knowledge across the regions. Key Interventions EPP 5: Powering Generation Expansion The establishment of a single buyer model for electricity in Somalia seeks to address the country’s growing energy needs while ensuring a stable and scalable electricity supply system. With a current electricity generation capacity of approximately 400 MW, primarily sourced from diesel generators, Somalia struggles to meet the increasing demand, leaving many citizens without reliable access to electricity. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 159 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 242 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 A single buyer model involves creating a centralised entity to procure electricity from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and distribute it efficiently to end-users. By consolidating electricity procurement, this approach reduces redundancies, stabilises electricity prices, and minimises operational inefficiencies. It also enables long-term PPAs with IPPs, providing a predictable revenue stream that encourages private investment in energy infrastructure projects. 80 SNTP I Lab Analysis 81 SNTP I Lab Analysis P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 7 FIGURE 47: CURRENT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE80 FIGURE 48: POWER GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION81 160 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 243 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 This model facilitates the integration of diverse energy sources, including renewables like wind and solar, to diversify Somalia’s energy mix and decrease reliance on costly diesel-based systems. It also ensures fair price regulations and grid reliability by balancing supply and demand. Ultimately, the single buyer model is expected to boost energy access for residential, commercial, and industrial consumers, reduce electricity costs, and support the expansion of generation capacity. By addressing these systemic issues, Somalia can enhance energy security, stimulate economic growth, and build a resilient and inclusive energy ecosystem. EPP 6: Accelerating Energy Inclusion The transmission and distribution sector in Somalia faces challenges due to outdated infrastructure, frequent disruptions, and limited regional connectivity, resulting in inefficiencies and high transmission losses. This project aims to establish a Transmission and Distribution company (TND Co.), incorporating government and private Energy Service Providers (ESP) as shareholders to consolidate the fragmented network and modernise the infrastructure. 82 SNTP I Lab Analysis The project includes comprehensive modelling and simulation of existing mini-grids and stand-alone systems, starting with Mogadishu. It identifies necessary upgrades, such as 132/33 kV substations, new transmission lines, and the conversion of substation voltage levels. By making these improvements, the initiative will bring together separate networks into a single framework. This will ensure reliable energy access and make electricity rates more consistent for customers.

Overview Somalia stands at a pivotal juncture in its journey towards fiscal sustainability and economic resilience. Public finance reforms and enhanced financial services are crucial to overcoming the structural barriers that have long constrained the economic growth. The government's approach to improving fiscal space, which primarily focuses on revenue mobilisation and expenditure management, has made significant progress while the domestic revenue collections increased 25% in 202383. The government doubled its efforts to mobilize domestic resources by expanding tax bases in to informal sectors. But the donor support has been very instrumental to the budget balance, with grants from outside the country making up a big part of it as shown in the following figure. Focuses on fiscal reforms, revenue mobilisation, and inflation control. Enhances financial inclusion and economic resilience. 83 MOF 2023 report 165 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 50: SHARE OF DOMESTIC REVENUE AND GRANTS(2019 - 2023)84 FIGURE 51: SOMALIA’S LOW TAX-TO-GDP RATIO AND RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL SUFFICIENCY - 248 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Over the past years, domestic revenue growth has demonstrated some improvement, reaching 45% of the Federal Government of (FGS) budget in 2023. However, grants still account for 55% of fiscal resources, underscoring the heavy reliance on external support. 84 Somali Medium Term Revenue Roadmap 2024-2027 85 Ministry of Finance In 2023, Somalia's tax-to-GDP ratio of 1.9% which is among the lowest globally, severely restricts its capacity to self-finance its public service delivery and development initiatives. This imbalance is made worse by the fact that the federal government and states don't always work together on their finances, institutions aren't always strong, and there is a big informal economy that employs over half of the workforce but doesn't bring in much tax money.

Numerous ministries of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) have identified strategic initiatives, including expanding the tax base, modernising revenue collection systems, and fostering public-private partnerships (PPPs). These initiatives aim to increase revenue-to-GDP to 10% by 2029, attract USD 6.2 billion in private investments, and formalise 20% of informal businesses. In parallel, efforts such as the establishment of a National Zakat and Waqf System are poised to leverage Somalia’s cultural and religious heritage to mobilise local resources and reduce reliance on aid. Moreover, the Key Results Area presents a clear roadmap for transformation, focusing on strengthening fiscal capacity, creating a conducive business environment, and accelerating private investments. Improving the way public funds are managed, making the infrastructure of the financial markets better, and making it easier to coordinate aid are some of the key things that will help these initiatives succeed and make reform last. This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for addressing Somalia’s fiscal and financial challenges. By implementing these reforms, Somalia can transition towards a self-reliant economy, foster inclusive growth, and build a resilient financial ecosystem capable of meeting the nation’s development aspirations.

Case for Change Despite various critical limitations, including security, the government doubled its efforts toward strengthening domestic revenue bases to generate income through tax and non-tax. The increase in external grants and tax revenue drove a spike in government revenue in 2022 and 2023. The revenue targets have consistently exceeded actual collections; the overall performance has been strong, apart from a significant shortfall in 202186. 86 Ministry of Finance 2023 87 Ministry of Finance 2023 88 Fiscal performance report 2023, SOMCAS 89 MOF 2023 Budget Report The primary contributor to tax revenue is customs duties, particularly on imports and exports, followed by income and sales tax. The customs tax—primarily consumables goods tax—generated USD 48 million in 2023, contributing significantly toward domestic revenue generation88. Taxes on international trade and transactions made up two-thirds of the tax revenue, whilst income taxes only made up one-tenth. In 2023, the government's domestic resources accounted for 65% of government expenditure ($471.3 million), while donor project funds accounted for 35% ($248.9 million). The budget for donor-funded projects increased steadily from $262M in 2021 to $487M in 2024. Despite budget increases, actual disbursements consistently lag behind, with only $129M in 2021, improving to $264.9M in 2024, but still well below the budgeted amounts89. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 FIGURE 52: DOMESTIC REVENUE PERFORMANCE 2019-202387 168 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 251 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The unutilised budget remains fairly constant around 29% of total expenditure, indicating a persistent gap between budgeted and actual funds received for projects. Without addressing this, critical development and infrastructure projects will continue to face delays, hampering progress on key national priorities. The majority of GLF expenditure is to finance the compensation of employees at $290 million, or 62% of total GLF expenditure. Administration and general services account for 41% of total federal government expenditure, amounting to $296.1 million. The security sector was the second largest expenditure at 27% ($191.6 million) of total FGS expenditure90. 90 Fiscal Report 2022-2023 91 MOF 2023 Budget Report 92 MOF 2023 Budget Report FGS spent 26% of its total revenue to finance security expenditure, evidence of security as a national priority. The rise in food and commodity prices, along with personnel pay increases, drove a 14% year-over-year increase in security expenditure to $192 million in 2023. Since 2020, the compensation for security personnel has surpassed that of civilians, and it has increased by 1.3 times in the past five years, reaching $155 million in 2023. Somalia's capital expenditure remains very low relative to other countries, largely due to the limited domestic revenue generation, weak governance, and a reliance on external aid. The country has a very narrow tax base, meaning that most capital expenditure is funded by foreign assistance, donor support, and loans. Furthermore, capital expenditure as a share of total revenue dropped from 4.4% in 2019 to 2.0% in 2023, indicating limited room for spending on development and infrastructure92.

Despite regional disparities in tax compliance and coordination, the fiscal transfer of 2023 indicates a slight reduction compared to the prior year, 202294. Despite these constraints, Somalia is well-positioned to leverage key opportunities for transformation. The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) has initiated the Medium-Term Revenue Roadmap (MTRR), a bold plan to strengthen revenue mobilization and modernize financial systems. With targeted reforms, Somalia has the potential to enhance domestic resource mobilisation, improve fiscal sustainability, and create an enabling environment for private sector growth. Somalia can strengthen its economy, become less reliant on aid, and speed up progress toward its national development goals by combining tax reforms, better grant management, and new financial services into a single plan.

This severely restricts the government’s ability to generate domestic revenue and finance public services independently. Heavy Dependence on External Grants Grants account for 55% of public revenue, exposing Somalia to volatility and unpredictability in donor funding. This dependency undermines fiscal sustainability and the government’s ability to plan long-term development. Fragmented Financial Governance Disparities in fiscal coordination between federal and state levels, coupled with weak institutional frameworks, impede efficient tax collection, resource allocation, and financial oversight. Prevalence of Informal Economy Over 50% of Somalia’s workforce operates in the informal sector, limiting the tax base and complicating efforts to formalise and regulate economic activities for greater revenue mobilization. Inefficient Revenue Collection Systems Outdated systems and limited technological infrastructure hinder the efficiency of tax administration, leading to significant revenue leakages and low compliance rates. Weak Public Financial Management The lack of robust systems for expenditure tracking and grant management creates inefficiencies, reducing the impact of public spending and delaying critical infrastructure and service delivery projects. Underdeveloped Financial Sector Limited access to banking and financial services, coupled with low financial literacy, restricts private sector growth and the mobilisation of domestic savings and investments. Vulnerability to External Shocks Somalia’s reliance on external funding and limited economic diversification leaves it highly vulnerable to global economic shifts, currency fluctuations, and climate- related challenges. Insufficient Capacity for PPPs The absence of frameworks and expertise for managing public-private partnerships (PPPs) restricts Somalia’s ability to attract private investments and implement large-scale development projects. Inadequate Zakat and Waqf Systems Despite cultural and religious potential, the Zakat and Waqf systems remain informal and underutilised, with fragmented structures and a lack of centralised management limiting their contribution to social protection and development. 171 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 254 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 8.3. Key Result Areas Somalia has made significant strides in recent years, but strengthening macroeconomic foundations by delivering public finance reforms and financial services remains a persistent struggle. The key national result areas include strengthening fiscal capacity by mobilising additional resources through private investment, widening tax bases, and implementing public finance reforms to improve government capacity for tax collection and management. 96 SNTP I Lab Analysis Key Result Area 1: Improving Revenue Mobilisation Somalia is at a critical juncture in its journey towards achieving fiscal stability, robust public finance management, and economic resilience. Addressing long- standing challenges in governance, resource mobilisation, and financial services requires a coordinated and systematic approach. Achieving sustainable economic growth and fiscal stability in Somalia hinges on three interconnected pillars: improving revenue mobilization and efficiency, strengthening fiscal management and governance, strengthening monetary systems, and creating an enabling business ecosystem. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 FIGURE 56: PUBLIC FINANCE REFORM AND ENHANCED FINANCIAL SERVICES HOUSE CHART96 172 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 255 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 These pillars are supported by important enablers like better management of public finances, stronger financial market infrastructure, better aid management, building capacity and capabilities, and better intergovernmental fiscal harmonisation. These enablers facilitate the implementation of initiatives across these pillars. Strategic Objective 1: Strengthening Public Finance Management (PFM)—The Foundation for Economic Resilience Despite significant reforms, attaining favourable positions of fiscal governance, transparency measures, and accountability frameworks is essential for elevating the PFM architecture of Somalia. Furthermore, this happens as there has been limited progression of budget information and reports, domestic revenue mobilisation, expenditure control mechanisms, and reduction of external public debt levels in Somalia in recent years. A robust PFM system is critical to addressing these systemic issues and challenges. By enhancing budget transparency, fiscal accountability, and expenditure efficiency, Somalia can unlock significant fiscal space to fund its National Transformation Programme (NTP I) priorities. The introduction of macroeconomic dashboards, advanced digital tools, and strengthened institutional frameworks will also help the government make data- driven decision-making and ensure that public funds are allocated toward transformative and high-impact initiatives. Due to the existing challenges, there is a need to improve the PFM architecture of Somalia through strengthening macroeconomic fiscal management and planning. Initiatives These reforms aim to increase allocative efficiency and enhance fiscal space, resulting in improved budget absorption to over 80% and reducing budget variance to below 5% by 2029. By addressing inefficiencies in public expenditure, Somalia will ensure greater alignment between fiscal policies and its strategic developmental goals, fostering stability and long-term economic resilience. !

Enhancing Oversight and Audit Mechanisms A robust oversight and audit framework is essential for ensuring financial integrity, preventing corruption, and strengthening public confidence in government spending. This intervention focuses on enhancing internal and external audit functions, improving financial reporting, and enforcing accountability measures. Key Actions: ! Establish Internal Audit Departments in All MDAs: To improve financial oversight and risk management, internal audit units will be established in all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs). These audit units will provide independent verification of government spending, enforce compliance with budgetary policies, and reduce financial mismanagement risks. Additionally, training will be provided to internal auditors to enhance their capabilities in forensic accounting, fraud detection, and expenditure verification. ! Finalise the SICPA Act and Establish the Regulatory Authority: The Somali Institute of Certified Public Accountants (SICPA) Act, currently awaiting presidential approval, will be finalised to establish an independent regulatory authority overseeing accounting and auditing standards. The SICPA Authority will be responsible for setting professional standards, accrediting accountants and auditors, and ensuring adherence to international accounting regulations (IPSAS and IFRS). ! Implement Digital Audit Standards and Legally Enforceable Practices: To modernise public financial audits, Somalia will deploy data analytics software and forensic auditing tools for real-time tracking of financial transactions and automated fraud detection. These digital systems will enhance transparency, improve compliance monitoring, and strengthen government financial integrity. ! Improve Legislative Oversight on Public Finance: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in Parliament will be empowered to conduct more rigorous reviews of government spending.

Public resources alone are insufficient to address the scale of infrastructure needs, given Somalia’s constrained fiscal capacity and heavy reliance on external grants. To close this gap, using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) is a game-changing way to get private sector investment, encourage new ideas, and make sure that important infrastructure projects are completed quickly and correctly. Despite Somalia’s growing commitment to PPP frameworks, challenges such as weak institutional capacity, inadequate legal frameworks, and limited public awareness have constrained the implementation of PPP projects. The establishment of a robust PPP ecosystem is essential for addressing these challenges and creating an enabling environment that attracts private investment, enhances risk-sharing mechanisms, and delivers long-term benefits to the Somali people. Initiatives This initiative is aimed at promoting private sector involvement of investing in bankable projects and stimulate infrastructure development, create conducive environment and achieve inclusive growth. The key driving forces of PPP exercise in Somalia includes but not limited to the need for infrastructure development, limited government allocation of budget to the basic services, and heart-breaking unemployment rates among the Somali population, which needs decent jobs and investment as such.

Federal and Regional Ministries: To align project implementation with national and local development priorities. Strategic Objective 3: Transitioning to Ad Valorem Tariffs to Strengthen Trade Revenues Somalia’s existing tariff structure, heavily reliant on outdated flat-rate methods, results in inefficiencies, trade disputes, and revenue losses. The absence of a harmonised and value-based tariff system disproportionately affects the predictability and fairness of tax assessments, creating barriers to trade compliance and eroding confidence among stakeholders. Flat-rate tariffs also fail to account for variations in the value of traded goods, leading to over-taxation of low-value items and under-taxation of high-value goods. Initiatives Transitioning to ad valorem tariffs initiatives could raise the Tax Revenue-to-GDP ratio to 6.5% by 2029, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.9%. Also, under the new system, some goods are expected to bring in over 200% more tax money. These figures underscore the urgency of reform to align Somalia’s tariff framework with international best practices P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 FIGURE 60: TAXES ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE FORECAST (USD MIL2021 – 2029)100 182 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 62: KEY STEPS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AD VALOREM TARIFF IN SOMALIA102 FIGURE 61: COMPARISON OF CURRENT AND REVISED TARIFFS101 265 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 101 Ministry of Finance, SNTP I Lab Analysis 102 Ministry of Finance, SNTP Lab Report 2024 Adopting ad valorem tariffs, calculated as a percentage of goods' value, provides a more equitable and transparent approach to taxation. By aligning with World Trade Organisation (WTO) guidelines, this reform would not only modernise Somalia’s customs valuation system but also foster a business-friendly environment essential for economic stability and growth. Key Interventions The Ministry of Finance, through its Revenue Department, is leading the implementation of the Transition to Ad Valorem Tariffs initiative. This comprehensive intervention aims to replace flat-rate tariffs with value-based ones, creating a fair and predictable customs framework. The reform focuses on five critical components which outlines the initiative’s steps toward modernising tariff valuation methods and classifications. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 183 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 266 As part of the reforms, tariff valuation systems will be looked at and standardised to make them more in line with WTO rules. Product classifications will also be improved to cut down on disputes, and tariffs will be brought in line with regional standards under the East African Community (EAC) framework. A pivotal element is the development of a centralised price reference database, ensuring accurate and reliable valuation of goods. Additionally, the government will also integrate digital tools like the Somali Customs Automated System (SOMCAS) to streamline processes and improve compliance monitoring. This system will support the implementation of standardised tariff codes, reducing ambiguities and disputes in customs procedures. To ensure stakeholder buy-in and smooth implementation, the initiative involves extensive consultations with traders, customs officials, and regional partners. These engagements are critical to addressing concerns, refining policies, and building trust in the new system. Projections indicate that the Transition to Ad Valorem Tariffs initiative will yield significant economic and fiscal benefits, revolutionizing Somalia's customs landscape and bolstering its trade revenues.

Despite this, approximately 90% of economic activities in the country take place in the informal sector, severely limiting the effectiveness of Zakat and Waqf as structured mechanisms for poverty alleviation and community development. Historically, Zakat has remained largely informal, fragmented, and underutilised, while Waqf assets, though significant in potential, lack formal institutionalisation and management structures. The absence of a formalised system results in numerous challenges, including unstructured collection and distribution mechanisms, a lack of transparency in the management of funds, and geographic inequities in resource allocation. A formal Zakat system ensures compliance with Islamic principles, accountability through audits, and equitable distribution to the eight asnaf (eligible categories of beneficiaries).

Clear governance structures will ensure accountability through published audits and digitalisation of collection systems. By doing so, the initiative aims to increase efficiency and improve public trust. Key categories of Zakat include Zakat Al Mal (wealth), Zakat Al Urudh (business goods), agricultural produce, and livestock. These categories align with the economic pillars of informal and agrarian economy, ensuring relevance and widespread applicability. It also aligns with broader economic goals, fostering financial inclusion, strengthening social safety nets, and improving economic resilience.

This will involve the creation of a National Waqf Registry to track and document Waqf assets, including land, buildings, and other properties. Dedicated Waqf zones and land-use policies will enhance the strategic allocation of assets, while partnerships with the private sector and NGOs will enable the development of revenue-generating ventures. Waqf funds will support sustainable investment strategies, asset maintenance, and perpetual funding for projects that provide community benefits. Awareness and education campaigns will complement these structural reforms, focusing on behavioural change to encourage formal contributions to Zakat and participation in Waqf initiatives. Collaboration with local communities, donors, and federal member states will ensure decentralized but standardised operationalisation, fostering inclusiveness and accountability. Key Interventions The Establishment of National Zakat and Waqf Systems initiative aims: ! To establish zakat and waqaf institutions ! To foster public-private partnerships for waqaf and Zakat initiatives ! To strengthen institutional capacity and development ! Infrastructure and social service investment pool ! To create robust, transparent, and equitable frameworks for the mobilisation, collection, management, and distribution of these funds. ! Collaborate with critical stakeholders such as the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MOLSA), Federal Member States (FMS), religious leaders, local communities, and international donors, including multilateral and bilateral partners, for implementing this initiative. The institutionalisation of the National Zakat and Waqf Systems is anticipated to yield transformative socio-economic benefits: ! Increased Financial Inclusion: By formalising Zakat and Waqf, more individuals and businesses will participate in structured almsgiving, expanding access to financial support for underrepresented groups. ! Enhanced Poverty Alleviation: Zakat will provide immediate cash assistance, food provision, and education for vulnerable populations, targeting the eight asnaf categories equitably.

Strategic Objective 5: Leveraging SDRB as instruments for financing and investment in the NTP Somali Development and Reconstruction Bank (SDRB) is positioned as a critical financing arm to actualise Somalia’s National Transformation Plan (NTP). Anchored in its mandate to promote economic growth, SDRB aims to catalyse private sector investment and support projects highlighted in the NTP. Key pillars of its mandate include: ! Financing underserved productive sectors such as agriculture, fisheries along with its enablers renewable energy and infrastructure. ! Strengthening financial inclusion through partnerships with microfinance institutions (MFIs) and commercial banks. ! Supporting large-scale infrastructure projects via Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). ! Promoting climate resilience and gender equity through targeted financial instruments. SDRB’s strategic alignment with Somalia’s National Transformation Plan (NTP) positions it as a pivotal institution to mobilise resources, de-risk investments, and accelerate implementation of NTP’s transformative agenda. By focusing on sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, energy, and infrastructure, the bank will help address key development challenges, including limited access to finance and infrastructure gaps. Between 2025-2029, SDRB plans to deploy $350 million in targeted investments, blending innovative financing mechanisms to unlock opportunities in Somalia’s rapidly transforming economy.

This transformative agenda will ensure that the bank remains a cornerstone of Somalia’s economic and social advancement. Key Interventions The Somali Development and Reconstruction Bank (SDRB) has launched a strategic initiative to strengthen key productive sectors, with a focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Through its Investment Readiness Program (IRP), the SDRB is equipping SMEs with the skills, knowledge, and governance frameworks needed to scale their operations and become eligible for financing. The program emphasises capacity building, financial literacy, and strong corporate governance, enabling SMEs to attract and effectively utilise funding. Additionally, the SDRB provides tailored and innovative shariah-compliant financial products, such as credit and equity investments, to maximize SME output, boost production, and create employment opportunities, thereby contributing to Somalia’s economic growth. Beyond direct support to SMEs, the SDRB conducts comprehensive assessments of the demand and supply dynamics within productive sectors to identify gaps and challenges. It offers targeted guidance, technical assistance, and advocacy for policy reforms to create a conducive business environment. The bank also supports enablers of the SME ecosystem, promotes technology adoption, and implements robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to ensure the effectiveness of its interventions. Key Result Area 2: Strengthening Fiscal Management and Governance Strategic Objective 1: Enhancing Aid Management — A Catalyst for Resource Mobilisation Somalia’s reliance on donor funding, which accounts for over 50% of the national budget, underscores the critical role of effective aid management in achieving its development objectives. However, fragmented coordination mechanisms, limited integration of aid data into national systems, and weak institutional oversight plague the current landscape. The lack of a unified approach has resulted in inefficiencies, duplication of efforts, and reduced alignment with national priorities. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 189 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 66: SOMALIA’S KEY CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS FOR AID MANAGEMENT106 272 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The absence of a comprehensive aid management framework has also eroded trust between donors and the government. With most donor contributions implemented through non-governmental channels, Somalia’s capacity to leverage aid for long-term development remains constrained. To ensure optimal utilisation of aid to support the National Transformation Programme (NTP I), it is essential to address these systemic issues. Initiatives The strategic initiative will mainly focus on leveraging the Aid Information Management System (AIMS) and establishing structured dialogue mechanisms, while the AMU ensures that donor contributions are aligned with Somalia’s strategic priorities. This comprehensive approach not only enhances coordination and accountability but also enables data-driven decision-making to optimize resource mobilisation. 106 SNTP I Lab Analysis By integrating aid flows with national priorities, the AMU plays a pivotal role in linking donor contributions to Somalia’s broader economic transformation agenda, fostering trust with international partners, and positioning Somalia as a regional leader in effective aid management. The AMU will consist of three specialised units: ! Aid Coordination and Policy Unit (ACPU): Responsible for aligning donor aid with national priorities and preventing duplication.

Key stakeholders include the Ministry of Finance (MoF), bilateral and multilateral partners, local and international NGOs, and implementing agencies. These entities will collaborate to streamline aid management processes, align donor contributions with national priorities, and build institutional capacity. Strategic Objective 2: Digital Transformation of Tax Collections Somalia's current revenue collection system faces significant challenges stemming from manual processes, fragmented systems, and limited taxpayer compliance, which reduce efficiency and transparency. The lack of centralised data management hampers compliance monitoring and increases revenue leakages, leaving Somalia heavily reliant on external aid and unable to fully fund critical public services and infrastructure development. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 191 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 68: DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF REVENUE COLLECTION108 274 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 108 SNTP I Lab Analysis These inefficiencies have also deterred taxpayers and businesses, contributing to a culture of non-compliance and creating bottlenecks in administration. Addressing these challenges through the Digital Transformation of Revenue Collection Initiative is critical to enabling Somalia to mobilise domestic revenue effectively. By digitising and automating its revenue processes, Somalia will create a streamlined, transparent, and user-friendly tax administration system capable of supporting economic growth and reducing reliance on external funding. Initiatives The Digital Transformation of Revenue Collection Initiative represents a pivotal step toward achieving fiscal sustainability in Somalia. By modernising its revenue collection system, the government is not only addressing inefficiencies but also strengthening its ability to mobilise domestic resources effectively. This initiative will ensure a more equitable and transparent fiscal system, fostering trust among taxpayers and unlocking Somalia’s potential for self-reliant growth. Key Interventions The Government of Somalia is spearheading the Digital Transformation of Revenue Collection Initiative to modernise and digitise its tax administration processes. The main goal of this project is to set up a number of connected systems, such as the Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS), the Non-Tax Revenue Portal (NTRP), the Somali Customs Automated System (SOMCAS), and the ETAS and POS systems. Together, these systems will transform revenue collection, making it more efficient, transparent, and compliant with international best practices.

Unified Registration: ! Introduce a centralised portal for taxpayer registration across all tax types (e.g., VAT, income tax, and customs duties). ! Assign a unique taxpayer ID for streamlined management and simplified compliance tracking. 2. Consolidated Filing and Submission: ! Enable electronic declarations for all tax types through a unified platform, with pre-filled data from historical filings to reduce errors. 3. Automated Assessment and Risk-Based Verification: ! Deploy systems that assess declarations automatically, flagging high-risk cases for review and significantly reducing processing times. 4. Centralised Payment System: ! Establish a secure, integrated platform for taxpayers to make payments online, reducing delays and ensuring real-time revenue tracking. 5. Comprehensive Record Management and Compliance Tracking: ! Digitise and centralise tax records, providing real-time compliance updates and proactive reminders for upcoming obligations. The Ministry of Finance will lead the implementation, working closely with the following stakeholders: ! International Partners: Partners like the World Bank, AfDB, and FCDO will provide funding, technical expertise, and capacity-building support. ! Government Ministries: Other ministries providing public services will collaborate to integrate their revenue-related systems with ITAS and SOMCAS. ! Taxpayers and Businesses: The initiative will address taxpayer concerns by simplifying processes, thereby increasing voluntary compliance. Strategic Objective 3: Establishing a National Revenue Authority Somalia’s current revenue collection system is fragmented, with revenue collection and administration divided between the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the Federal Member States (FMS). This disjointed framework results in administrative inefficiencies, revenue leakages, and overlapping mandates that undermine the country’s fiscal performance and economic stability. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 193 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 276 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 As demonstrated in the figure below, the current system comprises seven separate tax administrations, requiring taxpayers to file taxes at multiple levels, which increases complexity and costs. Additionally, the lack of a unified tax framework leads to unequal fiscal positions among states, as highlighted in the revenue disparity across regions without ports. 109 SNTP I Lab Analysis 110 SNTP I Lab Analysis The absence of harmonised tax policies and efficient administrative processes also limits revenue mobilisation, weakens enforcement, and undermines public trust in government institutions. For example, revenue leakages and tax evasion are still big problems because of separate roles and little coordination. Also, regional tax competition makes it harder for everyone to get the resources they need. Initiatives The proposed National Revenue Authority will centralise and streamline revenue collection processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency across federal and state levels. This initiative, led by the Ministry of Finance, requires the creation of a legal framework to operationalise the authority. The framework includes provisions for harmonising tax codes, modernising customs and tax administration, and enhancing transparency and compliance.

Increased Revenue Efficiency: Centralised revenue administration is projected to enhance efficiency by 10%. This improvement will significantly reduce leakages and strengthen revenue mobilisation capacity. ! Harmonised Fiscal Policies: The NRA will standardise tax codes and procedures, reducing administrative complexity and enhancing compliance. This is anticipated to foster investor confidence and improve Somalia’s economic competitiveness. ! Improved Public Trust: Transparent tax collection systems and robust stakeholder engagement will enhance public confidence in the government’s fiscal management, encouraging voluntary compliance. ! Equitable Development: The revenue-sharing framework will address regional disparities, enabling the government to allocate resources effectively for infrastructure and social development.

The Somali Shilling (SOS), last issued before the 1991 collapse of central banking, has been relegated to limited markets, often as counterfeit notes114. As a result, vulnerable populations, including rural communities, urban lower-income groups, internally displaced persons, and small-scale traders, face significant transaction costs and barriers to economic participation. Initiatives Reintroducing the Somali shilling as a stable, legal tender is a transformative initiative to restore monetary sovereignty and economic stability. It provides a pathway to reducing dependency on the US dollar, improving monetary policy effectiveness, and laying the groundwork for an inclusive financial system that fosters innovation and poverty alleviation. However, achieving this requires addressing structural challenges, including Somalia’s nascent financial sector, limited foreign reserves, and the widespread circulation of counterfeit currency. To anchor public expectations and build confidence, Somalia must adopt a clear monetary policy framework aligned with the realities of its economy. Stabilizing the new currency, lowering risks, and making sure it fits with long-term development goals can be done through a currency board arrangement or a managed floating exchange rate. By reintroducing a stable national currency, Somalia will empower its financial institutions to develop locally priced financial products, reduce transaction costs for the marginalized, and support the nation’s broader fiscal and economic reforms. The Somali shilling is not merely a currency but a cornerstone of Somalia’s journey towards self-reliance and sustained growth.

The initiative’s key focus areas include: 1. Design and Printing of Banknotes: The CBS will oversee the design and issuance of secure, high-quality banknotes, integrating advanced anti-counterfeit measures. This step will ensure that the newly issued currency inspires public trust and addresses existing vulnerabilities to counterfeit operations. 2. Currency Exchange Implementation: The exchange process will involve replacing counterfeit and outdated notes with the new Somali shilling. Strategic partnerships with Money Transfer Businesses (MTBs) will facilitate this, leveraging their extensive networks to reach underserved and insecure regions. 3. Establishment of a Robust Exchange Rate Framework: CBS will adopt a rule-based monetary policy framework, such as a currency board arrangement, to stabilise the new currency. Foreign reserves and clear policy guidelines will support this framework, ensuring alignment with economic fundamentals. 4. Capacity Building within CBS: Strengthening institutional capacity within the CBS will be critical for effective currency management. Key measures include staff training, the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and the development of robust currency oversight and management protocols. 5. Public Awareness and Inclusion Campaigns: CBS will launch extensive public education campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits and practical use of the Somali shilling. These campaigns will target both rural and urban populations, ensuring that the reintroduction of the currency is inclusive and widely accepted. 6. Counterfeit Mitigation Measures: Robust anti-counterfeiting mechanisms will include high- security features on notes, clear exchange protocols, and stringent accounting systems to maintain the integrity of the currency exchange process.

However, critical gaps remain, particularly in regulatory frameworks and the modernisation of the Somali Payment Switch (SPS), which is essential for ensuring interoperability across banks, mobile wallets, and other financial service providers. Initiatives The Somali Payment Switch (SPS) initiative aims to establish a resilient and interoperable financial infrastructure aligned with international standards. By enhancing regulatory frameworks, strengthening governance, and implementing advanced technologies, the initiative seeks to enable seamless, secure, and efficient financial transactions. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing financial inclusion, fostering economic growth, and positioning Somalia as a regional leader in financial market infrastructure.

These figures underscore systemic inefficiencies stemming from outdated policies, fragmented enforcement mechanisms, and limited taxpayer compliance. This reliance on external aid leaves the government constrained in funding critical infrastructure and public services, while inefficiencies perpetuate inequities in revenue mobilisation.

Reforms to the income and sales tax systems, both in terms of policy and enforcement, will fill in structural gaps, bring in more money, and encourage people to follow the rules. Moreover, integrating digital and e-commerce transactions into the tax system and harmonising tax laws at the federal and state levels are critical to achieving fiscal sustainability and reducing the country’s dependence on external donors. A robust tax base will not only increase government revenue but also provide the financial resilience needed to invest in long-term development. The reform initiative begins with income tax reforms, which aim to reduce the corporate tax rate from 30% to 15%, addressing distortions caused by excessive deductions and non-compliance. The reforms also include harmonising tax rates between the federal and state levels and broadening the tax base to include untaxed income sources, such as those from remote work and informal sectors. By standardising income tax regulations and reducing administrative hurdles, the government seeks to create an equitable and predictable taxation environment conducive to investment and compliance.

This comprehensive intervention focuses on income and sales tax reforms, supported by legislative and digital enhancements, to broaden revenue coverage, improve compliance, and foster sustainable economic growth. The focus of parallel efforts is on sales tax reforms, which aim to implement modern taxation systems like VAT and GST. These reforms will expand tax coverage to include digital and e-commerce transactions while strengthening compliance mechanisms through digital tools like ETAS and POS. It is envisioned that the introduction of these systems will streamline enforcement, reduce leakages, and enhance transparency in revenue collection.

Leveraging integrated digital platforms, such as the Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS) and Somali Customs Automated System (SOMCAS), the initiative will centralise tax records, automate compliance monitoring, and enable real-time tracking of revenue data. These systems will improve efficiency, reduce redundancies, and enhance data-driven policymaking. The implementation of this initiative will significantly strengthen Somalia’s fiscal resilience by diversifying and modernising its revenue sources. The reform’s key outcomes include: ! Increased revenue collection: This is projected to enhance income tax revenue to 0.8% of GDP and sales tax revenue to 2.0% of GDP by 2029. This growth will reduce Somalia’s reliance on external aid and provide the financial resources necessary for critical infrastructure development and public investments. ! Enhanced taxpayer compliance: By simplifying tax procedures and leveraging user-friendly digital platforms. These reforms will foster a culture of voluntary compliance among businesses and individuals, improving overall tax administration.

Improve transparency and accountability in revenue collection: Centralised systems for monitoring and compliance will reduce errors, eliminate redundancies, and strengthen trust in the government’s fiscal management. ! Long-term economic stability: By creating an environment conducive to private-sector growth. Lower corporate tax rates, harmonised policies, and streamlined processes will encourage business expansion, attract investments, and create a more robust economic foundation. Strategic Objective 3: Enhancing Financial System Stability and Inclusiveness Somalia's financial system faces significant challenges stemming from limited access to formal financial services, unreliable credit data, the absence of a collateral registry, and a large unbanked population. These issues have hindered economic resilience and constrained opportunities for individuals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to access affordable credit. Despite recent progress, the country lacks the necessary financial infrastructure to support broad-based financial inclusion. The limited rollout of the National Identification (ID) system further exacerbates these issues by restricting secure identity verification and impeding access to financial services. The unavailability of a credit information database undermines lenders' ability to make informed decisions, increasing credit risk and deterring financial institutions from expanding access to underserved communities. Similarly, the absence of a collateral registry prevents individuals and SMEs from leveraging movable assets to secure credit, perpetuating economic exclusion. Somalia’s financial system reforms aim to expand access to formal financial services, improve financial infrastructure, and foster economic resilience. By leveraging the National Payment System (NPS) and integrating Somalia’s National ID rollout, the government will enable secure identity verification and unlock broader credit opportunities. Initiatives Key priorities include enhancing financial literacy, establishing a credit information database, and reforming legal frameworks to facilitate SME financing. These reforms are expected to increase access to formal financial services by 25% by 2029, driving financial inclusion and supporting SME growth. The figure below illustrates the proposed comprehensive approach to building credit infrastructure, enhancing financial literacy, and reforming the regulatory framework to address these systemic gaps.

Introduction of Credit Information Database: Establishing a comprehensive database to track credit behaviour and creditworthiness will enable lenders to reduce credit risks and make data-driven decisions. This initiative will also support economic growth by broadening access to credit for SMEs and underserved communities. 2. Introduction of Collateral Registry: A unified platform for registering movable assets, such as vehicles and equipment, will empower borrowers, particularly those with limited fixed assets. By enabling non-property owners to secure loans, the registry will significantly strengthen financial inclusion and drive entrepreneurship. 3. Enhancing Financial Literacy: Nationwide financial literacy campaigns will educate individuals and SMEs on essential financial knowledge, including credit management and savings. These campaigns will leverage community partnerships and include surveys to assess gaps in financial inclusion, ensuring targeted interventions. 121 Central Bank of Somalia (CBS), SNTP Lab Report 2024 P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 FIGURE 80: A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IN BUILDING CREDIT INFRASTRUCTURE, ENHANCING FINANCIAL LITERACY, AND REFORMING REGULATIONS121 206 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 289 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 4. Reforming the Legal and Regulatory Framework: Expedited enactment of financial regulations, such as the Financial Institutions Law and Insurance Bill, will align Somalia with international standards. Integrating the National ID system with financial services will further streamline compliance and verification processes, reducing fraud and strengthening the regulatory environment. It is anticipated that the implementation of these initiatives will deliver transformative outcomes for Somalia’s financial system: ! Increased Financial Inclusion: Expanding access to affordable credit and financial services is expected to increase financial inclusion by 25% by 2029, enabling underserved populations to participate in formal economic activities. ! Economic Growth: Enhanced credit access will boost SME development, promote entrepreneurship, and stimulate local economic activity. ! Reduced Credit Risk: The credit information database and collateral registry will minimise loan defaults and improve transparency in lending practices. ! Improved Financial Literacy and Awareness: Public education initiatives will empower citizens to make informed financial decisions, fostering long-term trust in the financial system. By integrating these reforms with the rollout of the National ID system, Somalia will create a robust and inclusive financial system that underpins sustainable economic growth and resilience. The successful execution of this strategic priority will position Somalia to overcome systemic barriers, unlock broader credit opportunities, and enhance the overall stability of its financial infrastructure. Strategic Objective 4: Robust Debt Management post-HIPC Somalia’s journey toward sustainable economic growth and fiscal independence hinges on its ability to effectively manage public debt. With the recent achievement of debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, Somalia has significantly reduced its sovereign debt burden, creating new opportunities for growth.

This composition underscores the importance of proactive measures to mitigate risks related to external shocks, exchange rate volatility, and interest rate variability. A robust debt management framework is essential to safeguard fiscal stability, enhance investor confidence, and provide a foundation for inclusive economic growth. Initiative Robust national debt management complements Somalia’s broader fiscal and monetary reforms, including enhancing public finance management and mobilising domestic resources. By establishing a robust debt management framework, Somalia will strengthen its fiscal resilience, attract investments, and support the implementation of the National Transformation Plan (NTP I). Key Interventions The implementation of these initiatives represents a transformative agenda for Somalia, aimed at strengthening public finance systems, enhancing financial services, and driving sustainable economic development. By addressing foundational challenges in governance, revenue mobilisation, and financial inclusion, Somalia is poised to achieve fiscal stability, economic resilience, and long-term prosperity. 122 Office of the President—State of the Economy Report—Volume II (November 2024) P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 208 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 291 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), through the Ministry of Finance (MoF), will implement a comprehensive Debt Management Initiative focused on five strategic pillars: 1.

Overview Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the cornerstone of Somalia's economy, accounting for approximately 95 percent of private sector employment123. These enterprises are pivotal in sectors such as agriculture, livestock, retail, logistics, and services, driving economic activity and providing livelihoods across the nation. In the absence of robust formal institutions, MSMEs have emerged as essential providers of goods and services, sustained economic functions, and fostered community resilience. Their adaptability and resourcefulness have been instrumental in maintaining economic stability amid challenges. However, MSMEs face significant barriers, including limited access to finance, inadequate infrastructure, regulatory inefficiencies, and technological gaps. Addressing these constraints is crucial to unlocking their potential as engines of growth, diversification, and employment creation. Increases women’s participation in business and financial access. Strengthens MSMEs for job creation and economic diversification. Supports business ecosystems and digital entrepreneurship. 123 World Bank, 2024 211 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 294 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Somalia’s NTP will prioritise a policy environment that supports MSME growth through targeted interventions such as regulatory reforms, access to credit, capacity-building, and integration into digital and global markets. This chapter provides a detailed exploration of the strategies, challenges, and Key Interventions necessary to foster MSME development. It highlights how MSMEs can serve as pillars of the NTP I, driving Somalia’s transformation into a resilient and equitable economy aligned with national and global development priorities. 9.2. Case for Change MSMEs in Somalia operate within a highly informal and necessity-driven business landscape, playing a crucial role in employment and service delivery. However, their presence in agriculture remains limited, with only 2.4% of household businesses engaged in processing purchased crops or livestock products for sale124. While agriculture contributes significantly to GDP, its direct impact on formal MSME activity is relatively small. Programs like Durable Solutions aim to bridge this gap by fostering youth entrepreneurship through innovation hubs, seed funding, and skills development. 124 Somali Country Private Sector Diagnostic 125 World Bank (2018), FAO (2024), and Somalia National Bureau of Statistics (2024) P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 FIGURE 81: AGRICULTURE & LIVESTOCK SECTOR CONTRIBUTES TO GDP125 212 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 295 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The service sector, encompassing retail, hospitality, education, and healthcare, accounts for 59.9% of total employment, and MSMEs are dominant within this landscape. Their contributions are essential not only for providing employment opportunities but also for fostering resilience, innovation, and inclusive economic development across Somalia. MSMEs play a key role in poverty reduction by providing income-generating opportunities, particularly for marginalised groups such as women and youth. TVET programs are an essential enabler in equipping youth and MSME entrepreneurs with technical skills aligned to market demands, addressing gaps in employment readiness. Women comprise approximately 52.7% of the population but face significant challenges in accessing employment opportunities. MSMEs help bridge this gap by creating informal employment opportunities in areas where formal jobs are scarce. The female labour force participation rate is 15.3%, significantly lower than the 38.4% rate for males . However, MSMEs provide avenues for women to engage in small-scale trade and other economic activities, thereby empowering them economically and contributing to broader social equity and poverty alleviation efforts. The large informal sector in Somalia employs over half of the workforce, limiting tax revenue and creating challenges for economic regulation. In 2019, 51% of employment was in the informal sector, compared to 43% in the formal sector. The relatively small formal sector underscores the difficulty in expanding stable, regulated jobs. 127 Ministry of Finance; The Somali Labour Force Survey (2019), Somalia National Bureau of Statistics (SNBS) P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 FIGURE 82: FORMAL AND INFORMAL SECTOR EMPLOYMENT, EMPLOYMENT DISTRIBUTION, AND RELEVANT LABOUR FORCE INDICATORS127 213 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 296 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Agriculture, which employs 26% of the workforce, remains particularly challenging to formalise due to its largely informal and subsistence-based nature. Additionally, the high rate of individuals classified as NEET (Neither in Employment, Education, or Training), particularly among youth, poses a significant long-term threat to social stability and economic growth, as they remain trapped in a persistent cycle of poverty. MSMEs also contribute to sustainable economic growth by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. They are instrumental in transitioning Somalia towards a more diversified and resilient economy, aligning with regional goals such as the African Union Agenda 2063 and the East African Community Vision. By enhancing local production and reducing dependency on imports, MSMEs support Somalia in building a more self-sufficient and balanced economy. 128 World Bank P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 S FIGURE 83: REGIONAL COMPARISON OF TIME REQUIRED TO START BUSINES 128 214 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 297 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Somalia's economic landscape is characterized by underdeveloped productive and tradable sectors, which impedes rapid structural transformation. The business environment in Somalia remains challenging, with the process of establishing a business taking approximately 70 days. This duration is the highest among comparable countries in the region, where the time required to start a business has consistently been under 40 days in recent years. Notably, for Somalia, this figure remained unchanged between 2016 and 2019. Complex and hard-to-understand procedures for business registration and licensing discourage informal enterprises from formalising, thereby limiting their access to finance and government support. 129 SNTP I Lab Analysis: The above comparison is only the FGS MDA Fees Structure and does not include FMS and the Banadir Region.

Informal enterprises often face difficulties in securing loans, adhering to regulatory standards, and establishing credibility with international partners, thereby limiting their growth potential and economic contribution. According to the ILO, informality of employment is also very high at over 80% in 2019 and is like the other countries in the region. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 FIGURE 85: BENCHMARK OF BUSINESS REGISTRATION FEES IN SOMALIA AND NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES130 FIGURE 86: INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT RATE BY SEX131 216 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 299 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 132 World Bank Report 2024 133 World Bank 2024 Entrepreneurship Women and youth are integral to Somalia's entrepreneurial landscape, representing a substantial segment of MSME owners. However, they encounter systemic barriers, including limited access to financing, high electricity costs, limited business development services (BDS),tax burdens, restrictive societal norms, and exclusion from formal business networks. These challenges hinder their ability to expand businesses and fully participate in the economy. Addressing these obstacles is crucial for fostering inclusive economic growth and harnessing the full potential of Somalia's entrepreneurial talent. Somalia scores 46.9 out of 100.0 according to the World Bank's Women, Business, and the Law 2024 which presents an index covering 190 economies and structured around the life cycle of a working woman132. The overall score for Somalia is lower than the regional average observed across Sub-Saharan Africa (74.0). Within the Sub-Saharan Africa region, the maximum score observed is 97.5 (Togo). Somalia does not attain a perfect score on any of the WBL2024 indicators. There is room for improvement across all eight indicators. Moreover, Youth in Somalia, comprising over 70% of the population, also face significant employment challenges. Fundamental Challenges Despite their significance, MSMEs in Somalia face numerous challenges that hinder their growth and sustainability. These challenges can be categorized into several key areas: P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 FIGURE 87: WORLD BANK—WOMEN BUSINESS & LAW INDEX133 217 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 300 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Access to Finance Access to finance remains one of the most significant barriers for MSMEs in Somalia. The financial sector is underdeveloped, with limited formal banking services available to small enterprises. High interest rates and stringent collateral requirements prevent many MSMEs from securing loans. Consequently, most rely on informal sources of finance, such as family and friends, which constrains their ability to expand operations. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as microfinance, credit guarantee schemes, and digital lending platforms, are essential to bridge this gap and support MSME growth. Crowdfunding and peer-to- peer lending also offer potential solutions to enhance financial inclusion for small enterprises. However, the lack of access to affordable capital continues to limit MSMEs' ability to invest in growth, innovation, and technology. Mobile money systems, such as EVC PLUS, Premier Wallet, and Zaad, have alleviated some of these challenges by enabling MSMEs to conduct financial transactions via mobile phones. Nevertheless, broader access to financial resources remains critical for sustainable growth and development. Infrastructure Deficiencies Infrastructure deficiencies present a significant challenge for MSMEs in Somalia. The country has very low geographic road penetration, with only 13% of the road network providing all- weather connectivity at 62°F. Poor road conditions increase the cost and inefficiency of transporting goods, particularly in rural areas, limiting market access and operational viability for small enterprises. The lack of reliable electricity compounds these challenges. According to SOMINVEST (2024), Somalia’s electricity tariffs are among the highest in the world, primarily due to reliance on imported diesel and outdated transmission infrastructure. High energy costs make it difficult for MSMEs to remain profitable and scale their operations. Furthermore, the absence of robust quality infrastructure has constrained MSME export growth. Initiatives like the Somali Quality Infrastructure Development Project (SQP) are addressing this gap by improving standardisation and certification capabilities nationwide. Improving infrastructure, including transport networks and energy supply, is crucial for reducing operational costs and enhancing market access for MSMEs. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 218 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 301 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Fragmented and Inconsistent Regulatory Environment Regulatory reforms are urgently needed to simplify business registration processes, reduce compliance burdens, and create a more transparent and predictable business environment. Establishing a one-stop shop for business registration and licensing, coupled with the implementation of tax incentives and relief measures for MSMEs, would significantly enhance the ease of doing business. These reforms would not only encourage formalisation but also strengthen the capacity of MSMEs to contribute more effectively to the economy. Technology Gaps MSMEs in Somalia often lag in technological adoption, limiting their capacity to innovate and compete in the global market. The lack of digital infrastructure, including reliable internet connectivity and access to modern technology, significantly hampers their growth. Key sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services still rely on traditional methods, which adversely affect productivity and profitability. Addressing these challenges requires investment in digital infrastructure, capacity-building programs to enhance digital literacy, and initiatives to promote the adoption of modern technologies. Bridging this gap is critical for enabling MSMEs to unlock their full potential in the digital era. Limited Access to Markets The lack of market information, combined with the dominance of informal trading networks, constrains their ability to scale up and compete effectively. These limitations are further exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and logistical barriers, which hinder the efficient movement of goods and services. Additionally, TVET programs focused on upskilling MSME entrepreneurs with digital literacy and e-commerce training are essential to overcoming these barriers, enabling businesses to integrate into regional and global markets. Initiatives such as access to market intelligence, participation in trade fairs and exhibitions, and leveraging e-commerce platforms can help MSMEs reach a broader audience and compete on a larger scale. Export promotion programmes and public procurement initiatives also hold considerable potential to improve market opportunities for small enterprises. Capacity Limitations Many MSMEs in Somalia face significant capacity limitations, including a lack of skilled labour, inadequate management practices, and limited access to technology. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 9 219 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 88: STANDARDISATION AND ENROLMENT TO SKILL-RELEVANT COURSES FOR EMPLOYMENT IN SOMALIA134 302 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The absence of formal training opportunities for business owners and employees leaves many enterprises without the skills required to manage and grow their operations effectively. Initiatives targeting areas such as entrepreneurship development and TVET programs address these gaps by enhancing business skills, financial literacy, and vocational training for youth and entrepreneurs. 134 FGS Fact Sheet 2022 Addressing these limitations requires comprehensive capacity-building initiatives. Entrepreneurship development programs, technical and vocational training, and the establishment of business incubators are essential to equipping MSMEs with the skills and resources needed to thrive. Additionally, enhancing digital literacy and integrating technology into business processes are critical for improving productivity and competitiveness in the modern business landscape. Regulatory Reforms and Business Environment Simplifying business registration and licensing processes is crucial for encouraging MSMEs to formalise their operations. Implementing online registration systems and one-stop service centres can streamline procedures, reducing administrative burdens and making the process more accessible and efficient. Additionally, introducing simplified tax systems, along with targeted incentives and relief measures, can enhance the financial sustainability of MSMEs. Protecting property rights, including intellectual property, is equally vital for fostering innovation and attracting investment. Strengthening the judicial system and adopting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms can improve contract enforcement and dispute resolution, contributing to a more stable and predictable business environment. Collectively, these measures create a supportive ecosystem where MSMEs can grow and thrive.

Overview The health of the national labour force and their productivity, the structure of the labour market, and the regulatory frameworks governing employment creation, inclusive growth, and equity of job opportunities will all be reflected in the employment and labour issues of the economy, which are among the driving machines of the national economic transformation agenda. Contrarily, while a few economic sectors, such as agriculture and construction, have contributed significantly, the unemployment rate, especially among men and young people, remains a serious challenge to the economy and needs attention from the policymakers. Promotes employment policies, youth employment, and labour market reforms. 228 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 311 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 10.2. Case for Change The current statistics indicate that Somalia's unemployment rate is still 21.4% overall136, with urban areas having a slightly higher rate at 21.7% than rural areas, which have a rate of 20.1%. The youth unemployment rate (30.1%) is concerning and disproportionately affects women (40.8%) compared to men (35.2%).137 In addition, cultural and societal standards, as well as restricted access to education and vocational training, are major obstacles to work for Somalian women, who make up only 20.3% of the labour force in the LFS 2019 compared to 45.9% of men. The overall labour force participation rate remains low at 32.40%, highlighting significant gaps in job creation and workforce integration. The lack of decent employment opportunities and the increasing threat of climate change and severe droughts have caused Somalia’s labour force, especially youth and women, to be internally displaced or to emigrate to other countries and continents. The lack of relevant employable skills due to limited opportunities for quality training contributes to youth unemployment or underemployment. The youth unemployment rate in Somalia as compared to peers in Sub-Saharan Africa is among the highest, second only to Djibouti. , 136 LFS 2019 137 SNBS 2023 138 ILO Stat P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 0 FIGURE 90: UNEMPLOYMENT RATE % FOR AGE 15-24138 229 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 312 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Fundamental Challenges !

Overview Infrastructure and logistics, which comprise transport sectors—mainly roads, aviation, and marine and ICT sectors—currently face significant deficits caused by climate change, insecurity, and lack of public investment, heavily deteriorated by civil conflicts that happened in Somalia139. The logistics and infrastructure sector is an enabler of national economic development given the country’s dependence on trade, particularly primary sectors, which contribute the largest portion of national GDP. The roads, which are in poor condition, hinder trade and regional integration by limiting connectivity between key economic hubs. Moreover, Somalia’s vast coastline remains underutilized due to insufficient seaport infrastructure and outdated equipment, which has restricted the handling of high cargo volumes. Similarly, the aviation sector is struggling to keep pace with post- conflict growth, with inadequate facilities to manage increasing passenger and cargo demand. Furthermore, given Somalia’s population demography coupled with the need for mobile phones and internet access, the ICT sub-sector became a critical enabler of the digital economy as well140. Expands transport, ICT, and energy infrastructure. Enhances urban planning and smart mobility. 139 National infrastructure strategy 2019 140 GSMA intelligence report 2022 235 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 318 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The sector, which also comprises various elements of technology and the telecommunication sphere, including mobile telecom, internet connectivity— primarily broadband, mobile banking, and e-commerce—has performed critical functions toward the socio-economic development of the Somali population. 11.2. Case for Change Transport According to the National Infrastructure Strategy (2019-2063), the classification of road data indicates that the country's overall road networks, comprising primary, secondary, and rural feeder roads, total 21,933 km. Furthermore, only 2,860, which is 13% of the total road networks, are paved, and the rest are gravel roads141. Similarly, feeder roads play a crucial role in improving regional connectivity and economic access in the major local districts and regions of Somalia and federal member states. Moreover, feeder roads, which primarily connect smaller towns and agricultural regions, are essential for supporting local trade. However, they often lack proper maintenance and investment. 141 AFDB assessment report (2020) 142 SNTP I Lab Analysis 143 SOMINVEST 2023 Somalia is strategically positioned to leverage its logistics and infrastructure sectors for economic growth, poverty alleviation, and enhancing regional integration. Improved logistics infrastructure can enhance Somalia’s export capabilities, particularly in its livestock sector, which constitutes 88% of the country's exports. The country has one of the lowest road densities among EAC nations and significantly hindered efficient transportation and connectivity143.

It ranks among the lowest globally in logistics efficiency and trails behind all EAC members, except for Burundi, across key performance indicators in the index. Efficient export processes would make Somali livestock more competitive in international markets, directly benefiting a large section of the population whose livelihoods depend on livestock. Moreover, fisheries, an underutilised sector with vast potential given Somalia's extensive coastline, could see a significant boost through better cold-chain infrastructure and export logistics. Somalia’s dependency on imports for essential goods such as food, construction materials, and medical products also highlights an opportunity to develop robust supply chains. Improved infrastructure could lower import costs, ensuring the affordability and availability of these critical goods, thereby supporting economic stability and growth.

While international donors, such as the World Bank and African Development Bank, provide over 90% of funding, private sector investment remains negligible. However, gradual investments in core trade corridors and improved paved road coverage could significantly enhance transport efficiency, foster regional trade, and strengthen economic integration. Addressing the gaps in road infrastructure is essential for Somalia to position itself as a competitive player within the region. Sea Ports Given the strategic location of Somalia and the significant opportunities of the Somali coastline, port infrastructure can play an inevitable role in transforming the economy and bridging the gap through regional economic integration. seaports, which are vital for international trade, face numerous operational and infrastructure challenges. The existing ports, including Mogadishu, Berbera, Kismayo, and Bosaso and Garacad, struggle with outdated facilities and inefficient operations. Limited port capacity and infrastructure hinder efficient cargo handling, causing delays and higher costs for importers and exporters. These inefficiencies drive up the prices of essential imports of food and medical supplies in Somalia. Additionally, inadequate connections limit the movement of goods inland, reducing the full economic potential of the ports. 321 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 148 UN Trade and Development, LSCI, Fluent Cargo Somalia has improved shipping connectivity ranking by 35% from 143 in 2015 to 93 in 2024 over the last 10 years147. This shows that Somalia has greater potential for global shipping networks, which can significantly impact trade efficiency and economic competitiveness. Somalia ports’ direct connectivity is confined to EAC and Middle East countries, while other ports in neighbouring countries have direct connectivity to South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Hence Somalia’s seaports have improved its liner shipping connectivity since 2015, but it remains less connected compared to other East African states. Hence, the lack of infrastructure in these ports has restricted Somalia’s ability to fully tap into regional and international trade opportunities, despite its strategic location on the major shipping routes. Moreover, this will support local economic growth, especially for industries such as livestock, fisheries, and small-scale manufacturing. Mogadishu Port has shown rapid growth in container traffic, with imports and exports experiencing a CAGR of 11% and 12% between 2019 and 2023 respectively. Projections suggest that this trend will continue through 2029, emphasising the need for port modernisation to accommodate growing container volumes, reduce operational inefficiencies, and meet the demands of global trade.

However, challenges persist in the form of inadequate handling capacity and shallow drafts, limiting their ability to accommodate large vessels. Somalia also boasts a network of minor ports, but many remain underutilized due to insufficient infrastructure and cargo handling facilities. Investment in these smaller ports could unlock new trade corridors, reduce reliance on major ports, and boost local economic activities. Despite its strategic advantages, Somalia's port infrastructure is plagued by inefficiencies. Limited handling equipment, outdated facilities, and inconsistent administrative processes lead to delays in loading and unloading operations, increasing operational costs for shipping liners. Aviation Given the strategic locations along the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, the Somali aviation sector presents significant opportunities for leveraging this lucrative industry. The recent expansion of airport service increases Origin & Destination (OD) passenger flights within Somalia, indicating strong domestic connectivity and facilitating travel between key regions. Somalia's aviation and cargo sectors are experiencing significant growth, positioning the country as a key player in regional and international connectivity. Domestic connection growth has been much slower than international in both passenger volume and flights. While passenger growth in pre-COVID was luminously published, recent data reveal that there is significant growth of domestic flights in 2020-2023150. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 1 240 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 97: DOMESTIC FLIGHT PERFORMANCE 2020-2023151 FIGURE 98: INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT PERFORMANCE 2020-2023153 323 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 151 MOTAA 2023 152 NTP lab report 153 MOTAA 2023 154 NTP lab report 2024 International traffic, which saw an increase in passenger numbers from 2020 to 2023, has primarily driven this air traffic growth. From 2020 to 2023, the number of international flights nearly doubled, while the number of passengers increased threefold during the same period. In total, civil aviation is being largely driven through international traffic, which is likely to be bolstered through further infrastructure improvement at Mogadishu airport152. While the increase in Origin & Destination (OD) flights reflects progress, the disparity in flight distribution between Mogadishu and other regions is stark, showing a huge gap. This suggests a highly fragmented market where numerous niche or regional airlines operate across different routes. The data also highlights disparities in international flight distribution, revealing how challenges beyond infrastructure, such as market demand, safety, and partnerships, influence air connectivity154.

Somalia’s airports lack sufficient storage facilities and cargo infrastructure, limiting their ability to handle large volumes and sensitive goods effectively. Improving storage capabilities at regional airports is vital for supporting Somalia's trade aspirations and accommodating its rising economic activities. However, challenges such as aging airport infrastructure, insufficient handling capacity, and limited personnel capabilities hinder efficient operations. Many airports lack modern facilities, including paved runways, operational taxiways, and adequate terminals to accommodate larger aircraft and growing passenger volumes, leaving the aviation sector underdeveloped and struggling with limited with limited airport services capabilities. To address these challenges, Somalia is investing in new facilities, including the planned New Mogadishu Airport, which will feature state-of-the-art infrastructure. And investments in modernising cargo infrastructure, such as improved handling and processing facilities, are essential to meet the rising demand for fast deliveries of perishable goods and high-value items. Through coordinated efforts of strategic Key Interventions, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation will unlock USD 16.1 million in private investment alongside the creation of 400 jobs by 2029. ICT The telecommunication sub-sector critically performed important functions, including providing mobile networks for the business and people, and has become the backbone of the ICT sector since the collapse of the central government of Somalia155. Furthermore, the internet access of the Somali population is also growing dramatically while the infrastructure is still limited and below the global standards156. Digital infrastructure is as important as the physical logistics infrastructure and is growing with increasing 4G penetration. However, a large mass is still not part of the digital ecosystem157.

This high penetration rate indicates a significant opportunity for expanding mobile-based services, including e-commerce and digital education. A significant portion of mobile money users receive their salaries or allowances directly into their mobile accounts, where 63% of users prefer to keep their funds there instead of cashing out159. Additionally, Somalia has made significant strides in mobile connectivity, particularly in leveraging mobile technology for economic development and digital services. The mobile money penetration rate in Somalia is high, indicating that approximately 73% of Somalis aged 16 and older utilise mobile money services. This figure is even higher in urban areas, where about 82% of adults use mobile money for financial transactions, compared to 72% in rural areas161.

Key Result Areas Somalia's strategic location on the Horn of Africa presents a significant opportunity for economic growth through improved infrastructure. It currently faces significant challenges across key infrastructure sectors—roads, seaports, and aviation, which hinder economic growth and connectivity. Addressing infrastructure improvements can foster social and economic inclusion by linking population clusters to economic hubs. And by investing in core trade corridors, expanding paved road networks, and modernising seaport and aviation sectors, Somalia can enhance regional connectivity, facilitate trade, and drive economic growth. Somalia will also capitalise on its participation in the Horn of Africa Initiative, a country-led framework which brings together key development partners—including the African Development Bank, European Union, United Kingdom, and Germany—to collaborate on priority regional projects and programmes. These efforts focus on four key pillars: infrastructure connectivity, trade and economic integration, building resilience to climate and other shocks, and human capital development. 163 SNTP Lab Analysis P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 1 FIGURE 102: HOUSE CHART: KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOGISTICS163 246 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 329 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 To significantly expand infrastructure capacity, improve road networks, and increase access to economic zones, the roads, seaport, and aviation sectors will need to undergo transformative changes with targeted investments in infrastructure, operational efficiency, and regional connectivity. These efforts are critical to fostering economic growth, improving regional integration, and supporting Somalia’s long-term development. All three sectors are concentrating on the following key outcome areas: ! Enhanced road transport networks: rehabilitating existing roads and constructing new trade corridors to facilitate the movement of goods and people, support trade across borders, connect rural areas with urban centres and expand access to global markets. ! Improved port efficiency and maritime services: improving port operations, investing into ports facilities, construction of deep see ports, and developing necessary fishing jetties to increase Somalia’s cargo handling capacity and storage spaces. !

The national key result areas include improvement of port operations, investment in port facilities, and developing necessary fishing jetties across selected areas. Strategic Objective: Improving efficient ports and maritime services from 390,000 TEU to 1,520,000 TEU by 2029 Somalia’s ports and coastal location provide a strong foundation for economic growth and trade expansion. However, realising this potential requires targeted investments in infrastructure, operational efficiency, and regional connectivity. By addressing its existing challenges, Somalia can position itself as a regional trade hub, linking landlocked nations to international markets and contributing significantly to its economic transformation. Through coordinated efforts of strategic Key Interventions, the Ministry of Ports and Marine Transport envisions attracting USD 453 million in private investment and the creation of 11,350 jobs by 2029. Initiative 1. Construction of New Deep Seaports Somalia's expansive 3,330 km coastline offers immense potential for trade, with plans to construct three new deep seaports in Mogadishu, Barawe, and Hobyo that will enhance cargo capacity and support economic growth. These ports aim to handle up to 2.25 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) annually, significantly improving trade efficiency. Mogadishu port, the largest in the country, faces constraints due to outdated equipment, making its modernisation essential for agricultural and livestock exports.

Overview Situated at the Horn of Africa—a strategic crossroads connecting Africa, the Middle East, and Asia— Somalia is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its geographic advantages to drive trade, attract investment, and foster regional collaboration. Regional integration is a cornerstone of Somalia’s NTP I to be implemented through the years of 2025–2029, reflecting the country’s aspirations for economic growth, social inclusion, and political stability. Market access opportunities must also be met with a corresponding supply side response. To date, despite improvements, informal cross-border trade continues to be dominated regional integration. By embedding these frameworks into its NTP, Somalia seeks to unlock market access, enhance infrastructure, attract investment, and foster resilience against shared challenges such as climate change, security threats, and food insecurity. Strengthens Somalia’s trade capacity and exports. Promotes regional economic integration (AfCFTA, EAC). 262 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 345 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Somalia is committed to coordinating policies, boosting trade, and building infrastructure that links economies and communities. This is shown by its active membership in regional groups like the East African Community (EAC), the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). Recently, Somalia joined the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting in 2025, marking a significant milestone in its diplomatic journey. 12.2. Case for Change Somalia's unique historical, economic, and geographic context shapes its path to regional integration. The country’s strategic location along key maritime trade routes has historically linked it to global economies, but internal instability, fragmented infrastructure, and a legacy of colonial division have hampered its ability to leverage these advantages fully. Somalia will also capitalise on the commitments under the various regional integration arrangements which should serve as a strong signal to the private sector reform. These regional initiatives prioritize aspects that promote cooperation under the EAC, IGAD, and the Horn of Africa Initiative, and AfCFTA for infrastructure connectivity, including transport corridors, power interconnections and single digital market. Recent milestones reflect Somalia’s renewed focus on integration: 1. EAC Membership (2024): Joining the EAC offers access to a dynamic regional market and a framework for harmonising trade policies and deepening economic ties. 2. AfCFTA Agreement: Approval of the AfCFTA underscores Somalia’s commitment to reducing tariffs, promoting intra-African trade, and advancing industrialisation. 3. Ongoing WTO Accession: Somalia’s progress toward WTO membership aims to align its trade policies with global standards, fostering investment and transparency. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 2 263 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 346 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 If we effectively harness strategic opportunities, Somalia's future trade holds significant promise. Membership in trade blocs such as the EAC, participation in AfCFTA, and potential membership in WTO offers vast potential for market expansion and economic integration. These platforms provide opportunities to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, enhance trade facilitation, and access larger regional markets for Somali goods and services. By aligning with regional standards and protocols, Somalia can strengthen its position as a vital trading partner in East Africa. The integration of new technologies also offers transformative potential for Somalia’s trade landscape. Digital platforms for customs processing and trade facilitation can streamline cross-border transactions, reduce inefficiencies, and lower the cost of doing business. Mobile money systems, already prevalent in Somalia, can be further leveraged to facilitate international trade payments, enhancing financial inclusion and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in export and import activities. Somalia’s extensive coastline presents untapped opportunities in blue economy sectors, including fisheries and maritime trade. Investments in port modernisation and marine resource management could position the country as a logistics and export hub for East Africa. Additionally, renewable energy projects, driven by solar and wind potential, can reduce reliance on imported fuels and create a sustainable energy base for industrial development. Looking ahead, Somalia’s trade prospects hinge on sustained investments in infrastructure, governance reforms, and private sector development. By focusing on export diversification, regional integration, and technological adoption, Somalia can build a resilient and competitive trade ecosystem that supports long-term economic growth and stability. The total value of 2023 exports in Somalia have rebounded a 29%. This growth can be attributed to the favourable rainfall experienced over the last two seasons. The improved weather conditions have had a positive impact on agricultural output, leading to increased exports and improved livelihoods. Moreover, 2023 total value of the country's imports was US$ 2,260.62 million, while the total value of exports amounted to US$ 340.96 million, resulting in a trade deficit of US$ 1,919.66 million. P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 2 264 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 106: LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE INDEX167 347 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The value of exported livestock increased by only 3 percent to US$ 233.93 million. While, crops and vegetable oil witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching US$ 49.66 million in 2023. Animal skins exhibited a notable increase, amounting to US$ 19.47 million. The fishery exports made a significant increase to US$ 3.34 million, while forest products showed a substantial increase, totalling US$ 13.64 million and livestock products made a significant decline of 70 percent from US$ 12.61 million to US$ 3.78 million. Trade Challenges in Somalia Somalia's trade sector faces several significant challenges that impede its economic development and integration into the global market. Key challenges include: Infrastructure Deficiencies: The country's transportation and logistics infrastructure is underdeveloped, with many roads in poor condition and key ports lacking modern facilities. This hampers the efficient movement of goods and increases costs and transit times for exporters and importers. The overall World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) for Somalia is 2.0 on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high), indicating significant challenges in its logistics sector. The country’s score is 1.5 in customs efficiency, 1.9 in infrastructure quality, 2.4 in international shipments, 1.8 in logistics competence, 1.8 in tracking and tracing, and 2.3 in timeliness. These scores reflect systemic issues across all measured dimensions and underscore the need for comprehensive reforms to enhance trade logistics and economic development. Compared to other countries in the region, Somalia’s LPI is the lowest. 167 World Bank P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 2 265 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 348 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Regulatory and Institutional Weaknesses: Somalia lacks robust trade policies and regulatory frameworks. This creates uncertainty for businesses and investors. The lack of a coherent national trade policy and weak institutional capacity hinder effective trade facilitation and compliance with international standards. Security Concerns: Persistent insecurity issues, including piracy and armed conflicts, pose significant risks to trade activities, deter foreign investment, and disrupt supply chains, leading to higher insurance premiums and transportation costs. Trade Imbalance: Somalia experiences a significant trade deficit, with imports far exceeding exports. This imbalance strains foreign exchange reserves and underscores the need for export diversification and enhancement. Dependence on Informal Trade: A substantial portion of Somalia's trade occurs informally, bypassing official channels and regulations. This limits government revenue from tariffs and taxes and complicates efforts to monitor and regulate trade activities. Somalia's attempts to fortify its economy, enhance living standards, and expand its regional influence are heavily reliant on trade and economic integration. These priority areas seek to maximise Somalia's potential due to its advantageous geographic location, abundant natural resources, and young population. 168 SNTP I Lab Analysis P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 1 2 FIGURE 107: REGIONAL INTEGRATION, TRADE DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL INCLUSION168 266 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 349 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 12.3.

Furthermore, for successful domestication of AfCFTA and COMESA, Somalia must focus on policy alignment, trade facilitation, private sector readiness, and institutional capacity building. Stronger enforcement mechanisms, trade infrastructure, and financial integration will help Somalia fully benefit from regional trade agreements. Key Interventions To successfully domesticate the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in Somalia, the Federal Government of Somalia should implement targeted Key Interventions across policy, trade facilitation, infrastructure, capacity building, and private sector engagement. 1. Ratify and domesticate AfCFTA and COMESA agreements through parliamentary approval and national legislation. 2. Review and update trade laws to align with AfCFTA and COMESA rules of origin, tariff schedules, and trade facilitation measures. 3. Develop a National AfCFTA and COMESA Implementation Strategy with clear action plans and timelines. 4. Harmonise Somalia’s legal and regulatory frameworks with AfCFTA and COMESA trade provisions, including rules of origin, tariff schedules, and dispute settlement mechanisms. 5.

Social and Human CapitalTransformation 355 O V E R A R C H I N G G O A L : Improving Quality of Life forAll Overview The NTP vision for social progress is concerned with building a resilient, empowered and inclusive society. Its approach seeks to bring about an improved quality of life for all Somali citizens, ensuring that changes made are both tangible and sustainable. Spanning critical sectors such as education, healthcare, social protection and economic empowerment, this pillar tackles the creation of robust systems that protect fundamental human rights and provide equitable access to socioeconomic opportunity. N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 273 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 274 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 275 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 358 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Social protection investments remain limited, and dependency on external financing creates sustainability concerns. Efforts to provide durable solutions for displaced populations are central to Somalia’s development agenda. Durable housing programs, legal land tenure systems, and livelihood support aim to integrate displaced persons into communities, reducing vulnerabilities and fostering national cohesion. These measures are complemented by psychosocial support and protection against gender-based violence (GBV), which disproportionately impacts displaced women and girls. Women’s empowerment remains a critical pillar in the fight against poverty and inequality. Strengthened legal frameworks, vocational training, access to credit, and leadership initiatives promote women’s economic participation and social inclusion. Creating safe environments for women affected by violence or displacement ensures dignity and protection while advocacy campaigns address harmful cultural norms. These combined efforts enable women to contribute more actively to Somalia’s development. Somalia’s youth represent a powerful driver of change. Programs targeting skills development, employment opportunities, and entrepreneurship empower young people to lead economic and social transformation. Through technical and vocational training (TVET), microfinance schemes, and mentorship initiatives, the nation seeks to address the youth unemployment crisis, reduce outward migration, and foster innovation. Promoting the rights of persons with disabilities (PWDs) is integral to building an inclusive society. The National Disability Bill, inclusive public infrastructure, and adaptive ICT tools enhance accessibility and participation for PWDs. Advocacy platforms and electoral reforms ensure that PWDs are represented in governance and have access to information, fostering equality and dignity. The NTP supports the national stabilisation agenda which reinforces education, access to quality healthcare, potable water, sanitation, and durable solutions for the vulnerable communities in NRAs. This includes constructing functional water boreholes, healthcare and education facilities, and deploying staff to deliver these services. P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 3 276 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 359 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The FGS recognising the urgent need for effective health systems, has developed a comprehensive stabilisation plan aimed at establishing essential health services in the NRAs to save lives of the citizens that have suffered under Al Shabaab and support recovery. In the education sector, the government plans to ensure that all children in the NRAs have access to education by identifying and addressing barriers as part of the overall objective of increasing the national enrolment rate. In the water sector, access to safe and reliable water is a fundamental requirement for transformation in NRAs to address the urgent and long-term water needs of these places and to focus on rehabilitating and constructing water infrastructure that has been destroyed by Al Shabaab, developing climate-resilient systems, and integrating traditional and modern technologies to ensure sustainability of the water. Investments in social protection, durable solutions, women and youth empowerment, and disability rights are essential for eradicating poverty and building an inclusive Somalia. By fostering resilience, equity, and national cohesion, these measures lay the foundation for sustainable development and national prosperity.

Theory of Change Somalia’s journey toward sustainable development hinges on addressing systemic inequalities, empowering vulnerable groups, and fostering inclusive economic growth. Guided by a comprehensive vision, the nation seeks to transform its socio- economic landscape through targeted key interventions in social protection, women empowerment, youth development, and disability rights. At the core of this transformation is the strengthening of the social protection system to alleviate poverty and vulnerability. By expanding social assistance, implementing adaptive social security systems, and enhancing social care services, the government aims to create a safety net that safeguards individuals during crises and fosters resilience among vulnerable populations, including displaced persons, women, older persons and persons with disabilities. Housing and nutrition programs, alongside childcare and educational support, provide critical pathways to stability, enabling families to break the cycle of poverty. Recognising the pivotal role of women in national development, Somalia’s initiatives focus on dismantling systemic barriers to gender equality. Strengthened legal and institutional frameworks combat Gender-Based Violence (GBV) while fostering a culture of inclusivity and accountability. Economic empowerment programs equip women with vocational training, access to finance, and leadership opportunities, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to governance and economic growth. Safe spaces and advocacy campaigns further protect and uplift women, promoting dignity and opportunity.

Technical and vocational training (TVET), employment service centres, and entrepreneurship programs foster innovation and reduce unemployment, addressing the root causes of migration. By nurturing a skilled, confident, and self-reliant youth population, Somalia ensures that its next generation becomes active contributors to sustainable development. Somalia's commitment to youth inclusion is reinforced through the MoYS strategy, which promotes youth advisory councils and decision-making participation, aligning with the NTP's focus on inclusive society. In parallel, the inclusion of persons with disabilities (PWDs) is institutionalised through the implementation of the National Disability Bill and adaptive infrastructure reforms. Inclusive electoral processes, accessible ICT technologies, and advocacy platforms amplify the voices of PWDs, ensuring they can fully engage in social, economic, and political spheres. By addressing systemic barriers and fostering inclusivity, these initiatives uphold human rights and promote equity across Somalia. This integrated approach prioritises resilience, equity, and inclusion, ensuring that all Somalis have the opportunity to thrive. By combining targeted key interventions with strong governance, Somalia is building a foundation for eradicating poverty and building an inclusive society.

The effects of droughts, crop failure, and water shortages exacerbate GBV in Somalia, as women and girls are forced to travel long distances for water, which increases their exposure to violence. Survivors of GBV face significant barriers to seeking justice, as customary justice systems often fail to support them, and caseworkers are at risk of retaliation from the community. To address these challenges, the National Transitional Plan (NTP) prioritises improving access to justice by engaging with various legal systems to better understand and address barriers to justice for GBV survivors. Key Interventions: ! Ensure that prompt, victim- cantered, independent, impartial investigations are conducted into all sexual and gender-based violence ensuring access to justice and reparations to survivors. ! Carry out extensive public awareness raising to address issues of stigma for sexual violence and establish and implement programs that involve representatives of the traditional and religious elders to strengthen community support. ! Reduce victim/ survivor re- traumatisation and re- victimisation while holding perpetrators of sexual offenses/SGBV to account through the justice system. ! Ensure that centres providing services and referrals for survivors of sexual violence work efficiently across the country. ! Establish expedited procedures for the handling of GBV cases, develop and share jurisprudence on sexual offenses/GBV matters in the country. ! Capacitate women and civil society organisations (CSOs) to contribute to preventing violent extremism. ! Strengthen protection mechanisms for women, girls, IDPs, conflict affected women with disabilities (CAWDs), and violence survivors through legal aid, legal reforms, and establishment of shelters. ! Adopt codes of conduct for the Somali Security Services that prohibit sexual violence and provide penalties for breach. 170 Somalia National GBV Strategy 2018 - 2020 P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 3 291 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 292 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 293 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 294 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 295 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 296 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 297 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 298 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 299 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 300 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 383 Key Interventions: !

These priority areas will be implemented through the engagement and collaboration of local authorities and displacement and affected communities. The Action Plan incorporates comprehensive and innovative approaches across the Humanitarian, Development and Peace Nexus (HNPN) involving various stakeholders, including governmental agencies, partners, and local communities, ensuring that the voices of displacement-affected communities are heard. Initiatives under this plan are aimed at sustainable development through innovative strategies in health, education, agriculture, employment, national cohesion, return and reintegration, promoting resilience and long-term stability in the affected regions. The collective efforts are geared toward fostering collaboration among international partners and local authorities, ultimately striving for enhanced governance structures and better living conditions for all citizens amidst ongoing challenges. The Solutions Pathways Action Plan is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Secretary-General’s Action Agenda on Internal Displacement, emphasising three interconnected goals: achieving durable solutions, ensuring protection and assistance, and preventing future displacement. Key elements of the action plan emphasise coordinated government leadership and the integration of displaced persons' experiences into national policies. The overarching vision promotes long-term solutions that prioritise the well-being of IDPs, creating a framework aligned with both national development objectives and international standards. By fostering sustainable development while addressing the root causes of displacement, this action plan serves as a critical step towards rebuilding lives and transforming the socio-economic landscape in Somalia.

The Federal Government of Somalia is committed to developing and implementing this action plan to meaningfully address the prolonged vulnerabilities of IDPs, vulnerable host communities, and returnees. The government aims to strengthen local governance to better support displaced populations. Local authorities are the frontline service providers; therefore, the Solutions Pathways Action Plan and the NTP prioritise building the capacity of local government to be very essential in supporting IDPs, returnees and other vulnerable social groups. Key Interventions: ! Strengthen existing government structures to implement durable solutions through enhancing functional local government administration in displacement- affected communities (DACs) hosting districts to implement durable solutions. ! Strengthen the Federal, FMS and BRA to coordinate durable solutions through existing coordination platforms. ! Develop and implement urban as well as District Development to foster ownership and sustainability of solutions Pathway initiatives for management of migration patterns, reduction of overcrowding, and prevention of strain on services. ! Engage and provide incentives to the private sector and diaspora to participate in and support the solutions pathways action plan. Enabler 2: Generating Reliable Data Ensuring the reliability of data is crucial for informed decision-making. Accurate and up-to-date information on the needs, locations, and conditions of IDPs is crucial for effectively planning and implementing the government’s pathways initiative. It is expected that durable solutions stakeholders, led by the Somali government, are aware of the progress IDPs are making towards durable solutions and can adapt where IDPs are not on course. Enabler 3: Financing Strategy The financing strategy for Somalia's durable solutions initiatives focuses on aligning existing resources, programs, and key interventions, as well as strategically incorporating new initiatives with the Solutions Pathways Action Plan and the National Transition Plan (NTP).

This composition underscores the importance of proactive measures to mitigate risks related to external shocks, exchange rate volatility, and interest rate variability. A robust debt management framework is essential to safeguard fiscal stability, enhance investor confidence, and provide a foundation for inclusive economic growth. Initiative Robust national debt management complements Somalia’s broader fiscal and monetary reforms, including enhancing public finance management and mobilising domestic resources. By establishing a robust debt management framework, Somalia will strengthen its fiscal resilience, attract investments, and support the implementation of the National Transformation Plan (NTP I). Key Interventions The implementation of these initiatives represents a transformative agenda for Somalia, aimed at strengthening public finance systems, enhancing financial services, and driving sustainable economic development. By addressing foundational challenges in governance, revenue mobilisation, and financial inclusion, Somalia is poised to achieve fiscal stability, economic resilience, and long-term prosperity. 122 Office of the President—State of the Economy Report—Volume II (November 2024) P I L L A R 2 | C H A P T E R 8 308 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 391 Key Interventions: The key initiatives include: !

Enabler 6: Fostering Gender Equity and Leadership Gender-sensitive workplace policies ensure women’s fair access to opportunities by addressing pay gaps, workplace discrimination, and harassment. Leadership programmes nurture women leaders, enhancing representation across all sectors. Supportive environments and mentorship initiatives encourage women’s participation in civic and economic spheres. Early education advocacy challenges gender stereotypes from a young age, fostering equitable opportunities for both boys and girls in education and beyond. Enabler 7: Enabling Inclusive Infrastructure for Persons with Disabilities Comprehensive accessibility standards create inclusive public spaces, digital systems, and educational opportunities for persons with disabilities (PWDs). Assistive technologies, such as adaptive devices, hearing aids, and screen readers, empower PWDs by facilitating mobility and communication. Inclusive dialogue with organisations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) ensures that programmes and policies reflect their needs. Collaborative advocacy platforms further amplify their voices, fostering broader societal inclusion and understanding. Enabler 8: Safeguarding the Rights and Wellbeing of Children Significant investment in education and healthcare ensures children receive robust foundational support to thrive. Strong enforcement of protection laws safeguards children from abuse, exploitation, and neglect. Community engagement initiatives raise awareness about children’s rights, promoting local accountability. Welfare monitoring systems facilitate data-driven approaches, enabling targeted key interventions for vulnerable children and continuous improvement of programmes to maximise impact.

The overcrowding of schools in urban areas, and lack of schools in rural especially conflict prone areas have led to disparities in distribution of resources and education outcomes. The inadequate education infrastructure has resulted in higher numbers of mixed facilities in most of the Federal Member States. The uneven distribution and limited number of secondary schools has deterred the transition of learners from primary to secondary school especially in Somaliland and Puntland.

Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment: findings of the Somali High Frequency Survey Efforts at federal and state level have led to increased enrolment of 1,679,162 in 2023 in both public and private schools as indicated in Table 11, with gross enrolment rates in Somalia being on an upward trend increasing from 864,572 in 2019 to 1,679,162 in 2023. Despite this increase, Somalia continues to lag the rest of the East African Community in both primary and secondary school enrolment rates as given in Figures 112 and 113. It is notable that access to education opportunities is particularly low among children in rural and nomadic communities, IDPs, girls and children with disabilities who are most affected by infrastructure limitations or protracted conflicts. Nearly 27 percent of children enrolled in primary school are older than 13 years, and more than 55 percent of those enrolled in secondary school are not between the ages of 14–17 years177.

The majority (79%) of the teachers work in private schools while the public schools host 21% of the teachers180. The education sector has struggled to grow its teachers to meet its rapidly rising enrolment numbers. Although the government has taken initiatives to recruit 3,000 teachers annually since 2022, there remains a shortage of teachers with a pupil teacher ratio of 46:1 at primary level as shown in Table 12. This is particularly concerning as the ratio for primary pupils to qualified teachers increases to 67:1, more than double the globally recommended ratio of 25:1. Amid teacher shortages, the government has developed the Teacher Policy (2021) aiming to attract more teachers into the public sector.

While many private schools exist to educate displaced and underserved populations, parallel education systems can pose risks for the Ministry of Education, such as increased regulatory challenges, fragmentation of curriculum, and increased disparity or elitism from fee-paying schools. Private sector schools are necessary stakeholders to engage, given that they operate between 15% to 96% of the schools in different regions. Table 11: Summary of Basic Education Teachers in Somalia181 Education in Somalia faces chronic underfunding, with heavy reliance on donor contributions and constrained government resources.

Theory of Change Somalia faces significant challenges in human capital development, with limited access to quality education, a shortage of qualified teachers, exclusion of vulnerable groups, and insufficient opportunities for gainful employment. These issues hinder economic growth, perpetuate inequality, and reduce resilience to social and economic shocks. The NTP I will transform Somalia’s education and employment system to provide accessible, equitable, inclusive and quality opportunities for all Somalis through the following focus areas, enabling the development of a skilled workforce that contributes to sustainable development driven by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education (MoECHE). The key national result areas include: 1. Equitable Access to Education: expanding infrastructure in underserved areas, implementing financial and community initiatives to raise enrolment to 75% in basic education, and supporting students transitioning into secondary school. MOECHE targets to increase literacy rate to 75% by providing Adult Education and increasing enrolment in TVET by 86%. 2. Quality of education across all levels to improve Form 4 examinations score averages to 80% by recruiting and training qualified teachers. MOECHE targets to provide opportunities for in-service teacher training and continuous professional development of existing teachers to meet growing enrolment numbers. The national curricula for the different sub-sector need to be finalised and implemented to improve the national learning outcomes. 3. Equitable and Inclusive Education: targeted interventions to provide education opportunities for girls, children with disabilities and children from underserved rural populations to increase the enrolment of vulnerable population to 30%. and improve the Gender Parity Index to 1.0.

Somalia currently has a high number of its population without any access to formal basic education with 65.5% of adults without basic education. This has been exacerbated by the ongoing natural disasters conflict which has disrupted education and schooling of children. The impact includes reduced dropout rates, enhanced livelihoods, and strengthened workforce capabilities, contributing to Somalia's socio-economic development. By promoting in-demand TVET courses, aligned to the national needs and demands of the current market. Graduates will be able to access high skilled and high paying job opportunities. This will help improve job opportunity outcomes as well as reduce the social stigma currently surrounding the TVET jobs – currently perceived as low paying and underappreciated. Key Interventions This initiative aims to address the education needs of out-of-school youth and adults by implementing the following Key Interventions: ! Enrolling 170,600 learners into adult basic education classes for youth and adults over 18. ! Implementing 3-12-month literacy and numeracy programmes for 600,000 adults without prior schooling through alternative pathways, such as Adult Education i.e. vocational training, accelerated learning programs, and skills- based courses. It ensures learners acquire market-relevant skills, improving employability and economic resilience. ! Increasing enrolment in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) from 22,995 to 72,995 youth and HE enrolment from 176,375 to 300,000 learners by constructing new 12 new TVET centres in the regions with no existing TVET Centres, rehabilitate 9 existing TVET centres, rehabilitate Lafoole Educational College, three new Somali National University (SNU) campuses and expanding/rehabilitate the main campus of Somali National University in Mogadishu. Additionally, the Rector’s Building at Gaheyr campus will also be rehabilitated. The implementation for this project will begin in 2025 and will end in 2029 with an achieved 75% enrolment of eligible adults and attained an overall programme completion rate of 85%.

Examinations are pivotal in upholding the quality of a nation's education system. The credibility and dependability of an examination system hinge on the competent and secure administration of examinations, ensuring that the results authentically represent the learners' performance. The government targets to improve the quality of education by enhancing the number and quality of teachers, enhance the implementation of a revised national curriculum and robust assessment systems. This Focus Area works to improve the quality of education includes expanding and improving the quality of the teaching workforce, implementing revised national curricula and improving the assessment systems as key levers to unlock improved education outcomes. Somalia faces not only a shortage of teachers, with a high pupil to qualified teacher ratio of 67:1, but also high numbers of unqualified and underqualified teachers. 31.5% of primary teachers and nearly 20% of secondary teachers do not hold formal teaching qualifications, especially in South West regions. as shown in Figure 121. This Focus Area is aligned with the recently reviewed Teacher Policy (2021, reviewed in 2024), which seeks to recruit 3,000 new teachers to address this shortage.

Moreover, the inclusion of employability-focused components, such as technical and vocational education, will ensure that students are better prepared to transition into the workforce. Standardising the curriculum across regions will further strengthen the education system by enabling smoother transitions for students and ensuring equitable learning opportunities nationwide. Key Interventions The key interventions in this initiative include: ! Curricula review and development i.e. development of standardised national Adult Education curricula, Quranic schools and Islamic Institutes curricula, TVET curricula and core higher education programs to align with the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and market demands; review primary, ABE, and secondary curricula to ensure standardization, create digital and e-learning curricula and platforms, Integrate cultural and heritage elements, environmental, climate change into curricula across all sectors and develop Somali Sign Language and Braille resources. In addition to that, the provision of learning materials across all education levels will be enhanced. The government will establish and the Somalia Curriculum Institute. ! Develop a national learning assessment system to strengthen school supervision and continuous formative assessments will be introduced at grades 3, 6, and Form 2 based on the national curriculum to measure learners’ foundational skills i.e. literacy and numeracy, improve learning performance, identify learning and teaching gaps, and guide targeted to improve education outcomes. Coaching and peer mentoring will be conducted to improve teaching capacity. Summative assessments including grade 8 and grade 12 examinations will be administered by the Federal Member states and Federal Government respectively each year. In addition, the government will establish and operationalise the National Examinations Board to manage national formative and summative assessments. Implementation for this project will begin in 2025 and will end in 2029 with successfully updated the primary, secondary and ABE curricula and developed as well as implement comprehensive and standardised curricula for TVET, Quranic and Islamic Institutes, Adult Education and ECE programmes.

Girls’ re-entry program especially for adolescent girls: this intervention will address barriers that lead to girls’ school drop such as early marriage, financial constraints and other cultural norms. Implementation for this project will begin in 2025 and will end in 2029 with an achieved a 50% Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) for girls in both primary and secondary education, promoting gender equity to a parity of 1.0 and increased educational access at all levels. 14.4. Enablers Enabler 1: Governance and Service Delivery Enhancement Somalia’s education sector has been undermined by weak governance and inconsistent service delivery, resulting in significant inefficiencies, inequitable access to education, and widespread mistrust among stakeholders. These challenges have perpetuated disparities in resource allocation and hindered the sector’s overall effectiveness. Strengthening governance mechanisms is critical to addressing these issues. Improved transparency and accountability will ensure more equitable distribution of resources, while robust oversight will promote efficiency and reduce corruption. Enhancing service delivery is equally vital, focusing on better school management, consistent provision of learning materials, and comprehensive teacher training programmes. This initiative will not only improve operational efficiency but also attract greater investment by instilling confidence in the sector’s management. It will streamline coordination among government bodies, donors, and private stakeholders, fostering a collaborative environment. Key Interventions To enhance urgent implementation of the transformative strategies in the plan, the government will: ! Establish and operationalize National Commission for Higher Education ! Establish and operationalize National Examinations Board ! Establish and operationalize Teachers Service Commission (TSC) N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 4 332 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 415 ! Establish and operationalize National Curriculum Board to enhance the quality, accountability and innovation in education in terms of building teacher capacity, curriculum review and implementation and establishing robust assessment systems to monitor learner outcomes. To effectively regulate the sector, the government will: ! Conduct capacity needs assessment at both Federal and State levels ! Develop capacity building strategy for Education staff at different levels ! Provide professional development trainings based on the identified capacity gaps ! Develop, review, validate and disseminate all key policy frameworks for the sector. ! Develop guidelines and standards of operations on the decentralized functions, ! Integrate technology to of teaching and learning methodologies, ! Strengthen partnership coordination and monitoring of education programs through coordinating routine Education Sector Committee meeting, Establishing Joint Education Sector Reviews, promoting intergovernmental coordination meetings and enhancing performance monitoring and evaluation. Ultimately, these reforms will build a more inclusive, reliable, and sustainable education system capable of meeting the needs of all learners and driving national progress. Implementation for this project will begin in 2025 and will end in 2029 with successfully operationalised the National Commission for Higher Education Board, National Examination Board, Teacher Service Commission, and National Curriculum Board. Enabler 2: Somali National Qualification Framework (SNQF) Establishment The lack of a structured qualification Authority and lack of an approved Somali National Qualification Framework (SNQF) in Somalia has led to inconsistent educational standards and difficulties in recognising academic and vocational credentials both locally and internationally. These gaps undermine the credibility of Somali qualifications, limiting opportunities for students and professionals to pursue further education or employment, particularly in competitive global markets. N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 4 333 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 416 The establishment of the Somali National Qualification Framework (SNQF) aims to standardise qualifications across all levels of education, ensuring a clear and comparable structure for academic and vocational achievements. This framework will enhance employability by aligning educational outcomes with labour market needs and facilitating greater mobility for learners and workers. Additionally, the SNQF will encourage investment in training and education programmes by providing a reliable system for assessing and certifying skills. By integrating formal and non-formal education pathways, it will promote lifelong learning, inclusivity, and skills development. Ultimately, the SNQF will serve as a cornerstone for Somalia’s socio-economic growth, fostering a more skilled and adaptable workforce. Implementation for this project will begin in 2025 and will end in 2029 with the National Qualification Framework successfully rolled out and Somali National Qualification Authority established and operationalised. Enabler 3: Sustainable Education Financing Heavy dependence on donor contributions compromises the sector's ability to engage in long-term planning and deliver quality education consistently. To address this, sustainable education financing seeks to introduce innovative funding mechanisms that reduce reliance on external aid while bolstering domestic resources. Key strategies include fostering public-private partnerships to leverage private sector investment and increasing government allocations to the education sector. These measures aim to secure stable and predictable financial flows to support essential areas such as teacher salaries, school infrastructure, and learning materials. By ensuring consistent funding, this initiative will enhance the stability of the education system, promote equitable access for all children, and improve the quality of schools and teaching. Furthermore, a resilient and well-funded education sector will contribute significantly to Somalia’s broader development goals by empowering its human capital and laying the groundwork for sustained socioeconomic growth. Implementation for this project will begin in 2025 and will end in 2026 with a National Education Development Fund established and an education budget for 2026 from 10.5% to 20% obtained.

Data-driven decision-making is essential to improving educational outcomes, ensuring resources are efficiently allocated, and learning gaps are addressed. The digital capture of learner’s attendance will provide the clear impact of the school feeding programme over time. Education datafication and digitisation will transform educational processes by providing measurable data managed via digital platforms. Incomplete and fragmented data collection across Federal Member States has affected the productivity of decision making at all levels of education. The Education sector uses two main platforms referred to as the Education Management Information System (EMIS) for basic education (primary and secondary), while the Higher education level uses Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) which was started in November 2023. To enhance the quality of data, the government will expand the geographical coverage of the Education Management Information System (EMIS) and Higher Education Management System (HEMIS) to ensure comprehensive, nationwide data collection, broaden the range of EMIS/HEMIS indicators to include diverse education sub-sectors, such as early childhood education, adult basic education, Islamic Institutes, tertiary programs and include features to measure learning outcomes (formative and summative assessments) and education financing. The government will also develop and operationalize TVET Management Information System (TVET-MIS) as well as Teacher Management Information Systems (TMIS). Somali National University will establish a Learning Management System, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Research Management Systems and Digital Library. Moreover, the government will Integrate digital literacy and data management modules into pre-service and in-service teacher training programs, ensuring educators and ministry staff are proficient in managing online systems and equipped for a digital education environment. Implementation of this project will start in 2025 and end in 2029 with a robust centralized EMIS, HEMIS, TMIS and TVET-MIS to provide real time data across the education levels and operations.

Despite notable improvements in life expectancy and access to basic healthcare services, Somalia continues to face severe disparities and resource limitations that hinder progress toward UHC. Somalia is in the initial stages of an epidemiological transition, characterised by declining maternal, infant and child mortality and increasing life expectancy at birth. The population of Somalia is estimated at 16.2 million (as projected by SNBS from population estimates of 2014) with a total fertility rate at an average of 6.9 children per woman. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 58 years (2019 data), and it is estimated that 45.6% of the population is under 15 years of age, and 75% is under 30 years of age190. Most of the young – including neonates, infants, children under the age of five, adolescents, and youths – are users of health services. Additionally, the country has an estimated 4.2 million IDPs191, a number that fluctuates frequently due to recurring natural disasters, especially drought and famine. Limited availability of health facilities is a major challenge to creating equitable access to healthcare in Somalia including newly liberated areas. It is estimated that only 27% of the population has access to essential health services, and only 40% can access healthcare within 30 minutes. Vulnerable populations, including women, children, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), face significant barriers due to poverty, geographic isolation, and systemic gender inequalities. Maternal healthcare access is low, with only 20% of births in health facilities and 31.9%192 attended by skilled personnel. Availability of emergency services is also very limited across the country, with less than 10% of facilities offering 24/7 emergency care.

Theory of Change The NTP I proposes a set of integrated reforms that expand access to essential services, improve quality of care, and strengthen governance and financial systems. The NTP I aims to transform Somalia’s healthcare sector and employment system to provide available, accessible and acceptable quality healthcare for all Somalis through the following focus areas, enabling the development of a skilled workforce that contributes to sustainable development driven by the Ministry of Health (MoH). The Key Result Areas (KRA) include: 1. Strengthening Maternal and Child Health: Expanding services for safe deliveries, neonatal care, nutrition and immunisation coverage for children. 2. Developing a Qualified Medical Workforce: A two-pronged approach to developing both primary care and specialist professionals through education, training and regulation. 3. Health System Strengthening: Building resilient health systems and infrastructure to improve health outcomes of all Somalis, reducing the disease burden. P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 5 FIGURE 121: HEALTHCARE SECTOR HOUSE CHART193 339 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 422 This pillar will be supported by key enablers, such as integrated and efficient governance structures that will support consistent healthcare delivery nationwide, while data-driven decision-making will be enhanced through comprehensive health information systems. These systems will improve resource allocation and planning, ensuring services reach underserved populations effectively. Financial sustainability will be prioritised by reducing reliance on donor funding and increasing government spending on healthcare to 10% of the national budget. This approach ensures long-term resilience and independence in service delivery. By 2030, Somalia aims to achieve significant reductions in maternal, infant, and under-five mortality rates, alongside increased life expectancy and improved health outcomes for its population. Through these efforts, the NTP I will lay the foundation for a healthier, more resilient, and equitable Somalia, fostering national growth, national cohesion, and stability.

Only 32% of women have access to skilled delivery services, and maternal mortality is concerningly high at 692 deaths per 100,000 live births. The infant mortality rate is 61 deaths per 1,000 live births for children under the age of 1, while the child mortality rate is 122 deaths per 1,000 live births for children under the age of 5 is 122. Contributing factors include dilapidated health facilities, insufficient emergency obstetric care (CEmONC and BEmONC), and poor infrastructure, including inadequate water and sanitation systems. Additional risks such as malnutrition, early pregnancies, and limited access to antenatal and postnatal care exacerbate maternal and child mortality rates. P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 5 FIGURE 122: KEY HEALTH METRICS AND SYSTEM CHALLENGES IN SOMALIA194 341 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 424 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Nutrition Acute malnutrition affects over 1.5 million children in Somalia; not only does this have immediate consequences on their susceptibility to illness, cognitive function and survival – but also longer term social and economic outcomes as adults. Malnutrition in pregnant mothers similarly puts their infants at risk of stunting, wasting and poor immunity. Addressing nutrition of both mother and child is a critical building block for many other health outcomes and holds potential to break intergenerational cycles of poverty. Immunisation With less than 50% of children receiving essential immunisations, Somalia faces a high burden of preventable diseases like measles, polio, and pneumonia, which contribute to elevated child mortality rates. Low vaccine coverage increases the risk of outbreaks, placing additional strain on Somalia's fragile healthcare system and exacerbating the vulnerability of communities already affected by conflict, displacement, and poverty. To address these gaps, the Maternal and Child Health Services pillar focuses on rehabilitating health facilities, enhancing workforce capacity, and integrating nutrition services. By prioritising hotspots with the highest mortality rates, these initiatives aim to strengthen the referral system, improve emergency care, and reduce malnutrition through cross-sector collaboration and donor support. This multifaceted approach is vital for sustainable health outcomes. Strategic Objectives 1. Achieve Universal Health Coverage: 40% by 2029 2.

The amount of water flowing along the two rivers varies greatly within the year. The average amount of water flowing across the Juba River at Luuq is 186 m3 per second, while along Shabelle the amount of water flowing across Beled Weyne is on average 75 m3 per second. Water availability varies significantly across Somalia, with rainfall ranging from 700 mm annually in the southern regions to less than 100 mm in the northeast. This variability exacerbates water scarcity, particularly during prolonged droughts and extreme weather events. Compounding this issue, Somalia's groundwater quality is alarmingly poor, with many samples exceeding safe salinity levels. The nation also faces significant water loss through high evaporation rates, which further strain limited resources. Institutional and governance challenges hinder effective water management. The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MoEWR), established in 2014, oversees policies and strategies for water resource management. However, weak regulatory frameworks, fragmented governance, and insufficient technical capacity impede the implementation of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) strategies. Somalia's score of 34 on the Integrated Water Resources Management Index highlights these challenges, which include a lack of national water quality standards and monitoring systems. P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 6 FIGURE 123: BREAKDOWN OF WATER SOURCES IN SOMALIA196 355 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 124: WATER SECTOR HOUSE CHART197 438 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 197 SNTP I Lab Analysis The absence of operational frameworks for transboundary water cooperation further complicates water management, given the reliance on shared rivers like the Juba and Shabelle. Limited development of storage and irrigation infrastructure along these basins has reduced agricultural productivity and increased vulnerability to floods and droughts. Financial constraints also pose significant hurdles. Somalia receives USD 29 million in water-related official development assistance annually, which is considerably lower than neighbouring countries. This limited funding restricts the scope of projects aimed at improving water access, quality, and resilience. The high cost of water, ranging from USD 1.20 to USD 4 per cubic meter in urban areas, reflects disparities in access and affordability. In alignment with SDG 6.5.2, which measures transboundary water cooperation, Somalia has made progress in adopting cooperative arrangements, engaging stakeholders, and securing financial support. These efforts are guided by key frameworks, including the National Water Resource Strategy (NWRS) and the Shabelle Basin Diagnostic and Strategic Action Plan. However, challenges such as data gaps, sectoral fragmentation, and legal differences between riparian states remain. Addressing these obstacles will require enhanced regional cooperation and capacity-building initiatives, as outlined in the Somalia-UNECE Roadmap for Accession to the UN Water Convention. Despite these challenges, Somalia has initiated several high-impact projects to improve its water sector. These include rehabilitating existing water infrastructure, developing climate-resilient water systems, and building small-scale water treatment plants in urban areas. Efforts such as the National Water Resources Strategy (2021–2025) aim to align with sustainable development goals and establish a robust governance framework. P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 6 356 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 439 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 16.2. Theory of Change Somalia aims to build a resilient and sustainable water sector that ensures equitable access, enhances water quality, and fosters effective resource management. Addressing critical challenges will support social stability, economic growth, and climate resilience. Somalia faces a severe water access gap, with only 2,200 of its 8,000 water sources functional. Investments in rehabilitating infrastructure and creating climate-resilient systems will expand water availability for households, agriculture, and livestock. By addressing rural and urban disparities, these efforts will reduce vulnerabilities, support economic growth, and promote cohesion. Groundwater contamination and a lack of national water quality standards threaten public health. Establishing a National Central Water Laboratory and implementing small-scale treatment and desalination plants will improve drinking water safety. These initiatives will reduce waterborne diseases, enhance health outcomes, and build public trust in water systems. Fragmented governance and vulnerabilities to extreme weather necessitate a robust IWRM strategy. Strengthening regulatory frameworks, improving monitoring systems, and fostering transboundary cooperation for shared rivers like the Juba and Shabelle will ensure sustainable resource management, mitigate floods and droughts, and support regional stability. Looking ahead, Somalia’s accession to the UN Water Convention offers opportunities for dispute resolution, climate adaptation support, and increased access to international funding. Strengthening partnerships with IGAD, UNEP, and other stakeholders will be key in advancing transboundary water governance and ensuring long-term water security for the country. Targeted investments in infrastructure, governance, and quality assurance will transform Somalia’s water sector. Improved access and quality, coupled with effective management, will result in healthier communities, greater economic opportunities, and a sustainable water system that underpins national development. The NTP I aims to develop Somalia’s water to provide accessible, safe and sustainable resources for all Somalis including newly liberated areas through the following focus areas contributing towards sustainable development driven by the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MoEWR).

This enabler supports financial stability through creative funding solutions that enhance water service delivery and infrastructure. Enabler 3: Community Participation Engaging local communities in water management initiatives ensures project sustainability and relevance. By involving community members in decision-making processes, programs are tailored to meet actual needs and gain public support. Enabler 4: Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) PPPs are key to improving water efficiency and expanding access. Leveraging private sector expertise and resources enhances innovation and ensures more effective service delivery in the water sector. Somalia water supply PPPs will be structured through joint financing models, where government support in regulatory facilitation will be complemented by private investment in infrastructure development. Enabler 5: Transboundary Water Resources Cooperation As Somalia’s water basins are transboundary, collaboration with neighbouring countries is vital for regional stability and resource sharing. This enabler focuses on establishing agreements and cooperative frameworks to manage shared water resources equitably and sustainably. Somalia has also been actively engaging in regional dialogues and international partnerships. The UNECE National Workshop on Transboundary Water Governance (February 2025) focused on fostering cooperative frameworks, while the MOEWR-UNEP study on the Shabelle River Basin provided crucial data to support informed transboundary collaboration and climate resilience planning.

National Housing Guidelines 201 Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Reconstruction ((MoPWH&R) (2021). Draft National Housing Policy 17.2. Theory of Change Housing is a basic need that provides family access to shelter and basic comforts while enabling the creation of demand for resources, physical infrastructure, labour, technology, finance and land200. Somalia’s housing sector faces immense challenges due to rapid urbanisation, population growth, and the displacement of vulnerable groups. Addressing these issues requires a holistic approach to provide equitable and sustainable housing solutions and the Somali government is committed to ensuring all Somali citizens both in the urban and rural areas, can live in affordable, secure and appropriate housing that meets their needs, particularly those with low incomes and IDPs201. The strategy centres on constructing diverse housing options, including affordable apartment complexes, residential villas for middle-income households, and low-cost housing for civil servants. By alleviating overcrowding and stabilising housing markets, these developments aim to enhance urban living standards and foster socio-economic stability. For internally displaced persons, refugees, and returnees, targeted shelter programmes provide secure and hygienic environments, reducing vulnerability and promoting integration into urban communities. Complementary measures such as secure land tenure and legal documentation ensure that all individuals can access housing with dignity and legal protection. These initiatives collectively strive to reduce housing inequities, empower communities, and create a foundation for sustainable urban growth. P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 7 FIGURE 125: HOUSE CHART: HOUSING AND URBAN PLANNING199 366 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 367 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 450 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Access to basic sanitation is a fundamental right and public service upon which improved health outcomes can be achieved. This figure is concerningly low at 39% nationally, although there exists a large disparity between urban and rural access (61% versus 20%). Only 8.5% of nomadic populations have access to quality toilet facilities, although this number increases to 54.7% in rural regions, and 72.5% of urban residents. A lack of awareness and education on hygienic practices are similarly concerning: 85.9% of nomadic populations practice open defecation, and only a third of the population use soap and water to wash their hands. Addressing these challenges through targeted housing initiatives will transform Somalia’s urban and social landscape. Constructing 410 apartment blocks and 600 villas across eight cities will alleviate overcrowding, stabilise rental markets, and promote economic growth by creating jobs and stimulating construction industries. Building 2,000 affordable housing units for civil servants will foster equity, morale, and socio-economic stability, while 20,000 shelters for IDPs and refugees will provide essential support for the most vulnerable. Ensuring access to legal documentation, land rights, and tenure security will further enhance inclusivity and sustainable development, fostering national cohesion and resilience in the housing sector. The NTP I supports specific Key Interventions to provide land and legal rights to IDPs, alongside broad-based reforms of the housing sector to ensure all Somalis from low-income and vulnerable groups are able to access safe, adequate and affordable housing, with improved living standards and equitable access to essential services. 202 Ministry of Public Works, Reconstruction & Housing, 2024 P I L L A R 3 | C H A P T E R 1 7 FIGURE 126: SUMMARY OF HOUSING ESTIMATES FOR 8 SELECTED CITIES IN SOMALIA202 368 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 369 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 370 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 371 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 454 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 !

Through creative industries, artistic expression, and heritage preservation, culture contributes significantly to economic growth and social stability. Intergenerational dialogue is critical to maintaining Somali traditions while integrating new ideas and identities that resonate with the 21st century. This approach, especially with the country's substantial youth population, ensures harmonious blend of modern communication methods with Somali traditions. The media also plays an essential role in promoting discussions on historical teachings, cultural rituals, and religious values, reinforcing national identity while fostering openness to innovation. Youth empowerment and peacebuilding are closely tied to cultural preservation. Somali youth, who represent a significant demographic, require spaces to explore their heritage while engaging in contemporary forms of education and dialogue. This dual approach not only nurtures national cohesion but also counteracts radical influences, promoting a peaceful and resilient society. Sports development complements these efforts, serving as a unifying platform for youth and communities. Revitalising sports infrastructure and creating inclusive opportunities for athletic participation fosters national pride, reduces youth migration, and contributes to health and economic development. The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs, remain central to these efforts, providing spiritual guidance and organising initiatives that align religious values with the broader goals of nation-building. By integrating cultural preservation, youth empowerment, and sports development, Somalia aims to build a society that respects its traditions while embracing pathways to modernisation and progress.

Theory of Change Strengthening Somalia’s education, cultural, and socio-economic sectors is foundational for fostering national unity, promoting peace, and driving sustainable development. The NTP I integrates key pillars, including cultural preservation, youth empowerment, advancing religious affairs, peacebuilding, and sports infrastructure, to create a cohesive and forward-looking society. By embracing Somalia's rich traditions while fostering innovation and inclusivity, these initiatives aim to address systemic inequalities, reduce conflict, and strengthen national identity. Cultural Preservation and Development is at the heart of Somalia's efforts to rebuild its national identity in an era of conflict, migration, and globalisation. Revitalising cultural institutions, including museums, arts centres, and historical sites, will safeguard Somali arts, music, and storytelling. These efforts will promote intergenerational dialogue, foster pride in Somali heritage, and provide platforms for celebrating the nation’s diverse communities.

Overview Somalia’s climate resilience and disaster risk reduction efforts focus on addressing vulnerabilities, transitioning to renewable energy, and modernizing water resource management. Historically, Somalia relied heavily on imported diesel generators, which accounted for a significant portion of its energy needs. This reliance created economic strain, with high operational costs exacerbating inequality, especially in rural and underserved areas. Additionally, the system’s vulnerability to external market fluctuations, including volatile fuel prices and supply chain disruptions, highlighted the fragility of Somalia’s energy infrastructure. The environmental impact was severe, with diesel generators contributing to high carbon emissions and air pollution. In the early 2000s, Somalia began adopting renewable energy on a small scale, primarily through decentralised solar and wind projects targeting isolated communities. While these efforts alleviated local energy deficits, they lacked strategic coordination and investment to scale. Chapter 20: Disaster Risk Reduction O B J E C T I V E : Building Climate Resilience and Disaster Management 407 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 490 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Over the past decade, renewable energy has become central to Somalia’s development strategy, leveraging its natural advantages. With solar irradiance levels averaging 6-7 kWh/m"/day and consistent coastal and highland wind speeds, Somalia has immense renewable energy potential. These natural assets have attracted international investment and technical assistance, with organisations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) supporting solar mini- grids and other renewable projects. Renewable energy projects have already demonstrated significant socio-economic benefits, including job creation in construction, installation, and maintenance. For example, solar-powered systems have improved rural electrification, which remains critical as only 36% of the population currently has access to electricity. These systems reduce reliance on costly diesel generators, making energy more affordable for households and small businesses. Renewable energy also plays a pivotal role in climate resilience, supporting critical sectors such as agriculture and water management. For instance, solar-powered irrigation systems help farmers adapt to erratic rainfall patterns, enhancing food security and reducing the risk of crop failures. Similarly, solar desalination plants in coastal areas address water scarcity by providing clean drinking water to vulnerable communities. Somalia’s water resource management is similarly evolving, blending traditional practices with modern technologies. Historically, Somali communities relied on systems like dams (rainwater reservoirs) and rotational grazing to manage scarce resources sustainably. However, the collapse of central governance in the 1990s disrupted maintenance, leading to aquifer depletion and widespread water contamination. Reports indicate that groundwater levels have dropped by over 30% in several regions, with salinisation further limiting potable water availability. Additionally, inadequate sanitation facilities and waste management contribute to waterborne diseases, which disproportionately affect children and the elderly. Recent efforts aim to rehabilitate and modernise water infrastructure. Projects focus on enhancing traditional systems with durable materials and integrating solar- powered pumps to reduce reliance on diesel. P I L L A R 4 | C H A P T E R 2 0 408 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 491 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies have been introduced to monitor water availability and guide investments. For instance, GIS mapping identifies regions with critically low water tables, enabling targeted interventions. Early warning systems for droughts and floods now use real-time data to improve disaster preparedness, reducing humanitarian crises and safeguarding livelihoods. Despite these advancements, challenges persist. Recurrent droughts, exacerbated by climate change, disrupt agricultural productivity and livestock-based livelihoods, which account for 80% of Somalia’s economy. Only 24% of the population has access to basic sanitation, while political instability and fragmented governance structures hinder cohesive resource management strategies. Financial constraints limit the scale of modernisation efforts, with many regions relying on outdated infrastructure. Emerging opportunities offer pathways for resilience. For example, international partnerships facilitate access to advanced technologies, financial resources, and best practices. Regional examples highlight potential solutions: Israel’s desalination and water recycling technologies demonstrate scalable approaches for coastal regions, while Ethiopia’s community-led irrigation projects underscore the value of decentralized water management. By integrating renewable energy solutions with data-driven water resource management, Somalia can address immediate vulnerabilities and lay the foundation for long-term sustainability. The use of tools like GIS, remote sensing, and automated systems ensures that interventions are targeted and efficient. These combined strategies not only mitigate the impacts of climate change but also enhance socio-economic development, strengthen public health outcomes, and position Somalia as a leader in climate resilience and disaster risk management.

A functional national forum enabling the regular exchange of disaster management knowledge, innovations and best practices. ! A centralised data collection system providing timely, accurate and actionable information for disaster preparedness and response. Key Result Area 3: Strengthening Disaster Risk Reduction Governance Ensuring effective disaster management in Somalia necessitates a robust enhancement of our disaster risk reduction (DRR) governance frameworks. Strategic planning and coordinated disaster management efforts at the federal level, coupled with practical implementation and service delivery at the sub-national level, are critical components outlined in this National Transformation Plan (NTP). Traditionally, responses to crises have been centralized, even when the affected areas are in the most remote parts of the federal republic. This approach often delays and complicates effective response measures. To overcome these challenges, the Somali Disaster Management Agency (SDMA) is committed to strengthening DRR governance by fostering collaboration across various sectors. This will be achieved by formalising multi-stakeholder coordination mechanisms that include government institutions, international partners, and community bodies. Such collaborative frameworks will enhance the integration of diverse resources and expertise necessary for timely and efficient disaster response. Moreover, the Agency will focus on establishing localized capacities that are crucial for preparing for and responding to climate-induced disasters. This involves training local emergency response teams, improving infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, and ensuring that local communities have the necessary resources and knowledge to effectively manage disasters. An essential addition to our strategy is the integration of climate migration considerations into our broader disaster risk reduction and resilience-building efforts. Given Somalia's vulnerability to climate-induced displacement, it is imperative to develop adaptive measures that support displaced communities. This includes planning for relocation, creating resilient resettlement programs, and providing support for livelihoods in safer areas. By incorporating these elements, the SDMA aims to build a comprehensive and adaptive disaster management system that not only responds to emergencies but also proactively manages the risks associated with climate change, ensuring long-term stability and safety for all Somali communities.

Projects like the Mogadishu-Jowhar road and Berbera Port enhancements serve as foundational pillars for improved logistics, fostering regional integration and economic activity. The fisheries sector, exemplified by Project Badmaal, is a testament to the potential of harmonised federal-state efforts. With tailored interventions in all states, the project seeks to modernise artisanal fishing, reduce post-harvest losses through cold chain infrastructure, and combat illegal fishing practices. The outcomes include improved livelihoods, food security, and export capacity, benefiting both regional communities and national revenues. Agricultural initiatives, supported by mapped project allocations across states, underscore the emphasis on sustainable development. From introducing high-yield seed varieties in Hirshabelle to improving irrigation systems in Southwest State, these initiatives address localised needs while contributing to national food security goals. 422 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 505 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Education and health access remain priorities. Expanded education infrastructure in Galmudug and enhanced healthcare facilities in Somaliland highlight federal-state collaboration to address disparities. These efforts are complemented by social inclusion initiatives, targeting youth, women, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), ensuring equitable access to opportunities and services. In the energy sector, the Revenue Distribution Agreement between FGS and FMS serves as a model for equitable resource sharing. Renewable energy projects, such as hybrid solar-diesel mini-grids in rural areas, bridge the urban-rural divide, promoting energy access while reducing costs. These efforts exemplify the shared vision for sustainable energy solutions across FMS. Major Projects in Each FMS A Critical component of fostering FMS development is the identification of flagship projects that address unique regional strengths and challenges: ! Jubbaland: Development of cross- border trade corridors, such as the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia- Transport (LAPSSET) corridor, aims to enhance regional connectivity and commerce. This initiative leverages Jubbaland’s strategic position to strengthen its integration into broader African markets, fostering infrastructure development and regional trade integration !

The National Transformation Plan envisions a Somalia where socioeconomic development is equitably distributed across all Federal Member States. Achieving this vision requires unwavering commitment to fostering FGS-FMS collaboration, addressing contextual differences, and leveraging regional strengths. The initiatives highlighted in this chapter demonstrate that harmonisation is not only feasible but essential for building a unified and prosperous Somalia. A call to action is extended to all stakeholders—from government entities to private investors and international partners—to support these efforts. Together, we can realise the transformative potential of these projects, driving equitable development that uplifts all regions and ensures that no Somali is left behind 424 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 507 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Somalia’s historical challenges with fragmented and unreliable data have significantly hindered evidence-based policymaking, effective resource allocation, and monitoring of national development plans. Decades of instability and weak institutional capacities left the country’s statistical infrastructure underdeveloped, with limited capacity to generate, analyse, and disseminate critical data. In such a context, national decision-making has often relied on outdated or externally sourced data, creating gaps in the ability to plan and implement transformative development programmes. Recognising these limitations, the re- establishment of the Somalia National Bureau of Statistics (SNBS) in recent years marked a significant step towards building a robust National Statistical System (NSS). Since 2012, SNBS has spearheaded efforts to conduct foundational surveys, including the High-Frequency Surveys, Integrated Household Budget Surveys, Labour Force Surveys, Business Establishment Census, Population Sample Survey and Health and Demographic Survey, in collaboration with international development partners. These efforts have laid the groundwork for a centralised and coordinated approach to statistical governance, though challenges persist in ensuring the comprehensiveness and quality of the data produced. Accurate, reliable, and up-to-date data is essential for implementing the NTP I. It enables evidence-based decisions on critical sectors such as agriculture, trade, and public health, ensuring that interventions are both timely and impactful. Reliable statistics also strengthen Somalia’s alignment with global benchmarks, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and enhance its ability to attract investments and international donor support. UN SDGs Addressed: Enhances Somalia’s statistical systems for better decision- making. 425 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 508 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 This chapter underscores the critical role of data in Somalia’s development journey, emphasizing the need for a modernised, integrated, and sustainable NSS to address existing gaps. By prioritising investments in institutional capacity, legal frameworks, and technological innovations, Somalia can transition to a data-driven approach to governance that underpins sustainable development and socio- economic progress. Case for Change Compared to neighbouring countries, Somalia's GDP-to-Data Investment Ratio is significantly lower, with only 0.1% of its GDP allocated to statistics, trailing behind Kenya (0.3%) and Uganda (0.25%). This disparity underscores the urgent need for increased funding to strengthen Somalia’s statistical capacity.207 Accurate, reliable, and up-to-date data form the cornerstone of Somalia’s NTP I, driving evidence-based policy formulation, resource allocation, and progress monitoring. In a nation rebuilding after decades of instability, the absence of robust statistical systems poses significant challenges to achieving sustainable development goals. Somalia’s economic and social progress hinges on the ability to make informed decisions backed by data. Yet, fragmented and outdated data collection practices have resulted in gaps that hinder effective governance. For instance, the lack of comprehensive statistics affects planning in key sectors like agriculture, education, and health, where resource misallocation can perpetuate inefficiencies and inequalities. Comparative benchmarks underscore the urgency of addressing Somalia’s data challenges. While Kenya and Uganda have advanced their national statistical systems, Somalia lags in metrics such as data coverage, timeliness, and accessibility. This disparity limits Somalia’s ability to attract investments and donor funding, both of which rely heavily on reliable data to assess impact and progress. In addition to national challenges, Somalia faces increasing demands from international stakeholders for compliance with global standards, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Meeting these expectations requires a significant upgrade in the country’s data infrastructure to enable accurate tracking of progress toward SDG targets. 207 World Bank, Statistical Performance Report, 2023 426 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 509 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Specific data gaps exacerbate the situation. For example, insufficient agricultural data impairs the government’s ability to support food security programs, while inadequate health data limits effective responses to public health crises. Similarly, fragmented trade data hampers the formulation of policies to boost economic growth and regional competitiveness. Somalia's ability to implement effective governance reforms relies heavily on accurate and timely data. The Somalia National Bureau of Statistics (SNBS) has made significant progress in improving national statistical capacity, with its Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) score rising from 19.6 in 2019 to 49.7 in 2023. This improvement was driven by the implementation of NSDS-I and ongoing plans under NSDS-II (2024-2029). However, data gaps persist, particularly in conducting the National Population and Housing Census and the Household Budget Survey, with an estimated funding requirement of USD 215.3 million. Strengthening Somalia’s statistical systems will be critical for evidence-based policymaking, economic forecasting, and improved governance accountability. Investing in a comprehensive and integrated National Statistical System (NSS) will address these gaps, enabling Somalia to: ! Develop evidence-based policies that promote equitable growth. ! Monitor progress effectively, ensuring alignment with NTP I objectives and SDGs. ! Build trust among citizens, investors, and international partners by enhancing transparency and accountability. The case for change is clear: without a robust statistical framework, Somalia’s development trajectory will remain constrained by inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and an inability to fully realize its potential. By prioritising the enhancement of its data systems, Somalia can unlock transformative growth and improve the well-being of its citizens. 427 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 510 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Fundamental Challenges Somalia faces a series of interlinked challenges that hinder the development of a robust National Statistical System (NSS) essential for evidence-based decision- making and achieving the NTP I objectives. These challenges fall into four key categories: Challenges Summary Production, availability, and use of quality statistics. A lack of comprehensive data across key sectors leads to inaccurate prioritization and poor targeting of the country’s national development needs. To contribute to the overall performance of the NTP, it is necessary to improve data efficiency, accuracy, and the collection of relevant and timely data. Harmonization of data collection methods, sampling strategies, and standardization with the regional and global statistical standards is paramount to enhance Somalia’s data credibility, accessibility, and utilization for national policies and programs Coordination and Integration The lack of a unified framework for coordinating data collection and sharing among federal, state, and local entities has led to significant fragmentation. Multiple agencies operate in silos, duplicating efforts and producing inconsistent datasets. This disconnect undermines the ability to develop a coherent and standardised statistical system, resulting in inefficiencies and data gaps that impede national planning and governance. Institutional Capacity Somalia’s statistical infrastructure suffers from inadequate technical expertise, outdated tools, and limited institutional resources. Over-reliance on donor-driven, program-specific surveys exacerbates this issue, as these efforts often fail to produce comprehensive and sustainable datasets. Moreover, the absence of skilled personnel trained in modern statistical methodologies restricts the country’s ability to generate, analyse, and utilise data effectively. Legal and Policy Frameworks The absence of a strong legal framework governing data collection, confidentiality, and dissemination presents another critical challenge. Without clearly defined policies and adherence to international statistical standards, Somalia struggles to establish credibility and transparency in its statistical outputs. This gap limits the country’s ability to meet international expectations, undermining trust among citizens, investors, and development partners. Data Quality and Accessibility Inconsistent, outdated, and incomplete datasets remain a pervasive issue. Somalia’s reliance on manual data collection methods and outdated methodologies has led to poor-quality data that is often unsuitable for informed decision-making. Additionally, challenges with data dissemination and accessibility prevent stakeholders from fully using the available information, further limiting its impact on national planning and development. 1 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 511 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 National Key Result Areas for existing data gap Establishing accurate, reliable, and up-to-date data systems is fundamental to Somalia's journey toward sustainable economic growth and development.

Alignment of NSDSII with NTP1 and Statistical Data for the next five years During the NTP consultations, sectoral data gaps were identified, and the need for accurate and reliable data was unanimously recognized from all the sectoral labs. To address these gaps, the SNBS developed the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics II (NSDS II) 2024–2029. This strategy outlines clear priorities for improving data availability and reliability, with estimated budget of $260.3 million. To support NTP1 progress reporting and address critical data gaps, the following statistical surveys and assessments are proposed. These have been carefully identified based on lab reports and are aligned with the objectives of the NSDSII. Their implementation will ensure data-driven decision-making and enhance the effectiveness of policies and programs under NTP1.

Over the years, Somalia has faced a multifaceted risk landscape characterised by political instability, security challenges, economic vulnerabilities, and climate- induced shocks. These risks have hindered the progress of reforms, disrupted essential services, and strained institutional capacities. Addressing these challenges is essential to build resilience and ensure the continuity of national development initiatives. Somalia’s commitment to mitigating risks stems from its recognition of their far-reaching implications for economic growth, public trust, and investor confidence. The National Risk Management Strategy seeks to provide a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across all sectors. This approach integrates key principles of transparency, inclusivity, and adaptability, ensuring that risk management efforts align with the nation’s development goals and stakeholder expectations. Recent advancements, such as the establishment of inter-ministerial coordination frameworks and the integration of risk considerations into NTP I projects, reflect Somalia’s determination to enhance resilience. However, significant gaps remain, particularly in institutional capacities, risk governance frameworks, and the availability of timely and accurate data. These gaps underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive and systematic risk management strategy. UN SDGs Addressed: Strengthens Somalia’s resilience against economic and political risks. 434 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 517 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The overarching objective of this chapter is to lay the groundwork for a robust risk management framework that not only addresses existing vulnerabilities but also anticipates emerging risks. By embedding risk management into national decision- making processes, Somalia aims to safeguard its development trajectory and build a foundation for long-term stability and prosperity. This chapter outlines the case for change, the fundamental challenges, the theory of change, and specific initiatives to strengthen risk management as an enabler of sustainable development. Case for Change Somalia’s dynamic risk landscape poses a significant threat to the successful implementation of the NTP I. Political instability, climate-induced shocks, economic disruptions, and limited institutional capacities collectively hinder the achievement of development objectives. To build a resilient and sustainable future, there is an urgent need to adopt a proactive approach to risk management that addresses these vulnerabilities and anticipates emerging threats. The absence of a robust risk management framework has historically led to resource misallocations, delays in project implementation, and reduced stakeholder confidence. For instance, insufficient preparation for climate-related events has resulted in severe economic losses and disruptions to essential services, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. Additionally, the lack of coordinated risk governance has exacerbated fragmentation among federal, state, and local entities, undermining efforts to mitigate risks effectively. Implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy is essential for fostering economic growth, enhancing public trust, and attracting investments. By integrating risk management into national decision-making processes, Somalia can ensure the continuity of development initiatives and create an enabling environment for sustainable growth. Key benefits include: 1. Improved Resilience: Proactively identifying and mitigating risks strengthens the capacity of institutions to respond to shocks and ensures the continuity of essential services. 2. Enhanced Public Trust: Transparent risk management processes build confidence among citizens and stakeholders, demonstrating the government’s commitment to accountability and preparedness. 435 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 518 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 3. Increased Investment: A robust risk management framework reduces uncertainties for investors and development partners, creating a favourable environment for economic activities. 4. Optimised Resource Allocation: Anticipating risks allows for more efficient use of resources, minimising waste and ensuring prioritisation of critical initiatives. The case for change is clear: without an integrated and proactive approach to risk management, Somalia’s development trajectory remains vulnerable to unforeseen disruptions. A robust strategy will enable the nation to safeguard its progress and build a foundation for long-term stability and prosperity. Fundamental Challenges Somalia faces significant challenges in implementing a robust risk management strategy, many of which stem from systemic vulnerabilities and historical fragmentation. Addressing these challenges is critical to building resilience and ensuring the success of the NTP I.

This theory of change provides a structured approach to embedding risk management into national decision-making processes, ensuring resilience and continuity in achieving Somalia’s development goals. The goal is to establish a proactive and adaptive risk management system that strengthens institutional resilience, safeguards development initiatives, and builds public trust and stakeholder confidence. To achieve this, specific key interventions are required: 1. Institutional Strengthening: Develop the technical capacities of public institutions to identify, assess, and respond to risks. This includes training government personnel, modernising risk management tools, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration. 2. Early Warning Systems: Implement monitoring tools to detect and respond to emerging risks, such as political instability, climate-related disasters, and economic shocks. Real-time data collection and analysis will enable timely key interventions and minimise disruptions. 3. Guiding Principles and Coordination: Ensure that risk management efforts adhere to principles of transparency, inclusivity, and adaptability. Establish a centralised framework to coordinate efforts across federal, state, and local levels, reducing fragmentation and improving efficiency. 4. Engagement of Stakeholders: Foster inclusivity by engaging marginalised groups, civil society, and private sector actors in risk mitigation efforts. Their participation enhances the legitimacy and effectiveness of risk management strategies. 437 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 520 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 Expected Impacts The implementation of the NTP I relies on a robust risk management framework that anticipates and mitigates potential disruptions. This framework will: ! Enhance Institutional Resilience: Strengthen public institutions’ ability to respond to shocks, ensuring continuity of essential services and minimising disruptions. ! Foster Stakeholder Trust: Transparent and accountable risk management processes will demonstrate commitment to preparedness and build public and investor confidence. ! Support Sustainable Development: By reducing vulnerabilities to risks, Somalia can prioritise resources for development initiatives and create an enabling environment for economic growth and social stability. The approach focuses on fostering inclusivity, leveraging real-time data, and aligning risk management efforts with national development priorities, ultimately building a resilient foundation for long-term progress. The risk management framework directly contributes to the NTP I’s topline indicators by safeguarding progress in GDP growth, job creation, and investment mobilisation. Proactive risk mitigation ensures that economic initiatives remain on track, attracting investments and fostering an environment conducive to business growth.

The Performance Monitoring Dashboard serves as the backbone for progress tracking, offering real-time insights into performance metrics, risks, and implementation milestones. Weekly updates and scorecards are submitted to the Cabinet to ensure leadership remains informed and capable of making proactive decisions to address emerging challenges. 208 The Central Delivery Unit (CDU), located within the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), will oversee and coordinate activities across all Ministerial Delivery Units (MDUs), ensuring alignment and effective implementation of national priorities. 462 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 536 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 In addition, the DU aims to centralise and enhance aid coordination to align donor funding with the NTP I and national priorities. Currently, Somalia’s aid management is highly decentralised, with 90% of funds channelled through implementing partners such as the UN, international NGOs, and local NGOs, while only 10% flows through the national monetary system. Under the DU, the Aid Management Unit (AMU) will drive a shift towards a highly centralised system, targeting 50% of aid to be managed through the national treasury and government channels. The AMU will oversee the coordination of aid, matching national priority projects with funding sources while fostering collaboration among government bodies, donors, and implementers to optimise execution. The unit will restart the Aid Information Management System (AIMS) to enhance transparency and accountability in fund management. Future aid allocation will prioritise development projects aimed at self-sufficiency and economic growth, while social and humanitarian projects will gradually taper as immediate needs reduce. This strategic approach will strengthen Somalia’s capacity to manage aid effectively, reduce dependency on external assistance, and ensure funding is aligned with long-term national goals. The DU operates on a clear reporting cadence to maintain transparency and accountability. Weekly reports provide timely updates to the Cabinet on KPIs, progress milestones, and risks. These are supplemented by monthly performance reviews between the Prime Minister and Sector Ministers to evaluate sectoral progress, address challenges, and make course corrections where needed. An annual report consolidates achievements, outcomes, and lessons learned, offering insights for future planning and priority-setting. This systematic reporting structure ensures consistent oversight and drives measurable results across all initiatives. 2 The DU facilitates regular performance reviews between the President, Prime Minister, and Sector Ministers to assess progress against KPIs and resolve critical challenges. These structured reviews ensure alignment across leadership and strengthen collective ownership of national priorities. By fostering regular communication and collaboration, the DU reinforces accountability while keeping the government focused on delivering results. Additionally, a proactive crisis and risk management framework enables the DU to identify and mitigate emerging risks that may hinder implementation. Real-time data from dashboards and progress reports allow for early detection of issues, which are escalated to relevant leadership or committees for resolution. By addressing challenges swiftly, the DU ensures minimal disruption to delivery timelines and keeps initiatives on track to meet their objectives. 454 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 537 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The establishment of the Delivery Unit will help create a transformative impact on governance and national development in Somalia. By enhancing accountability, it ensures that sectoral ministries remain responsible for achieving national priorities. By establishing the DU, a culture of efficiency and coordination across ministerial delivery units will help streamline processes and promote greater collaboration. A structured risk management framework will help in identifying and addressing crises early, minimising disruptions in delivery. Regular reporting cycles and performance reviews drive a results-oriented culture, improving service delivery and citizen outcomes. Ultimately, the Delivery Unit promotes measurable progress, stronger governance, and long-term national stability. Overall, the Delivery Unit under the OPM serves as a cornerstone of Somalia’s implementation strategy for the National Transformation Plan. Through its focus on monitoring, evaluation, risk management, and performance review, the DU ensures that national priorities are achieved efficiently and transparently. By institutionalising structured processes, the DU drives accountability, strengthens leadership oversight, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. This approach positions the government to deliver tangible results as outlined in the NTP I, eventually contributing to Somalia’s development, stability, and growth. 455 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FIGURE 130: ANNUAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR NTP I209 538 N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 The successful delivery of the NTP I for 2025–2029 requires a substantial and well- coordinated financial commitment from multiple stakeholders. The total investment requirement is estimated at USD 26.2 billion over the five-year period, highlighting annual funding needs segmented by key contributors: The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), the private sector, and development partners (donors). This breakdown illustrates the shared responsibility of mobilising resources to drive Somalia’s transformation agenda, with each year reflecting an increasing investment demand to support the NTP I’s strategic priorities. By leveraging domestic resources, fostering private sector participation, and securing international donor support, the plan aims to deliver impactful and sustainable outcomes that align with Somalia’s long-term development vision. It is important to note that the cost estimates presented are preliminary and will be further refined during implementation. Given the evolving global landscape and shifting national priorities, some items may require adjustments over time. The government will adopt an agile and adaptive approach, ensuring that additional funding requirements are identified and addressed through a structured annual tabulation process. Furthermore, through the yearly publication of an NTP annual report, the government will provide updates on fund utilisation, progress, and emerging financial needs. While certain interventions depend on government and donor funding, private sector-driven initiatives are expected to proceed independently, as the focus remains on unlocking investments rather than direct financing. This dynamic and iterative process underscores that the NTP is not a static document but a living strategy—continuously improved to reflect Somalia’s evolving development priorities and implementation realities. 209 SNTP I Lab Analysis 456 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 African Development Bank African Economic Outlook African Journals Online Annual Education Statistics Report 2022-2023 CCCM Cluster Somalia.

to 20th September 2024, took place in the capitals of various states with the primary objectives and focusing on identifying political, social, and economic challenges and exploring opportunities for implementing the NTP 2025-2029. Key stakeholders from various sectors- including government, private sector, Civil Society, and international partners actively participated, discussing state challenges, priorities, and potential solutions. In addition, also brought together representatives from local districts to discuss issues pertaining states development initiatives, priorities and the inputs towards development area. These deliberations provided a collaborative platform for stakeholders to voice their outlooks and perceptions on the unique challenges, potentials and facing each state Participants shared insights on prioritizing key areas for development, such as improving governance, enhancing social services, strengthening economic resilience, and addressing security concerns. Additionally, the consultations facilitated the exchange of ideas on potential solutions and initiatives that could drive forward the successful implementation of the NTP, paving the way for a more cohesive and inclusive approach to development. The Federal Member State (FMS) Consultation Report on the National Transformation Plan (NTP) 2025 2029 reflects a critical component of Somalia's planning and development framework. These consultations aimed to align state-level priorities with the broader national agenda. The discussions were designed to identify political, social, economic, and environmental challenges while proposing actionable solutions to drive sustainable development. All the state governments in Somalia (Galmudug, South West, Jubbaland, Hirshabelle Banadir and SSC-Khatumo) highlighted that, they face significant political instability insecurity, economic downfalls, and infrastructure challenges. These consultations aimed to understand these challenges and develop a framework for future development. The consultation aimed at inclusive participation from all society segments, emphasizing, transparency, inclusive decision-making, and identifying policy gaps across all sectors. 473 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 557 Purpose and Objectives The consultation process was guided by the overarching goal of ensuring inclusivity and transparency in Somalia’s development planning. It emphasized capturing the unique needs and perspectives of each federal member state to address pressing challenges, strengthen governance, and foster resilience. Through this initiative, the Government of Somalia sought to engage various segments of society in shaping the National Transformation Plan, ensuring that voices from all regions and demographics contributed to the formulation of sustainable solutions. Key objectives included: ! Identifying core challenges and opportunities in governance, economic development, social services, and climate resilience. ! Facilitating collaboration between stakeholders to prioritize initiatives aligned with the NTP pillars. ! Promoting inclusive decision-making by integrating feedback from grassroots levels, such as local councils and civil society organisations. Consultation Methodology A mixed-method approach was utilized during the consultation process, the methodology included incorporating a variety of techniques to ensure comprehensive data collection and analysis. The consultation also culminated in a validation meeting where presentations facilitated that synthesis both quantitative and qualitative findings, focus groups, and presentations, yielding both quantitative and qualitative insights. Desk Reviews: a comprehensive pillar desk reviews analysis was undertaken prior to FMS consultation discussions to provide a clear understanding of pillar performance and enabling a thorough identification of existing gaps. It also helped to contextualize the consultations by drawing insights from previous literature reviews, ensuring a more informed and targeted approach to addressing pillar-specific challenges. Strategic Workshop: A one-day strategic workshop was conducted in each state, bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, private sector, civil society representatives, academics, and delegates from local districts. The primary objective of these workshops was to provide an, induction, introduction and overview of the consultation and structure of the National transformation plan. In this workshop, the NTP pillar leads presented the findings from the prior desk reviews and outlined the methodologies to be employed during the consultation process. This one-day workshop served as a platform to align stakeholders' understanding and ensure informed and collaborative discussions throughout the consultation. N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 474 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 FMS consultation report for NTP 2025-2029 558 Surveys: An online survey was conducted during the consultation days to collect relevant information about the states and their development priorities. This approach allowed participants to share insights and perspectives on key challenges and opportunities across various sectors, providing valuable quantitative data to complement the qualitative findings from other consultation activities. Group Discussions: The participating participants were divided into pillar-based groups to ensure comprehensive coverage and in-depth understanding of the overall challenges, priorities, opportunities and strength within the thematic pillars and their respective sub- pillar. These pillar-based groups served as a framework for systematically addressing critical challenges, priorities and solutions for each challenge or priority. The economic pillar was grouped into three main sub-pillar groups including productive sector (mainly agriculture, livestock and fishing); infrastructure (mainly transport, ICT, energy,) and private sector as well. The social and human capital pillar was also grouped into three main sub- pillars including, education, healthcare, social protection, water and sanitation, labor and youth as well as other cross-cutting sector including gender, disability and culture and information sharing. The transformational governance was divided into three main sectors including security and rule of law, inclusive politics and public sector reform. In addition, the environmental and climate resilience pillar wasn’t divided into groups but considered one group as the MDAs and other groups busy with environmental and climate resilience pillar are very minimal. A structured question was provided to describe key challenges, opportunities, and priorities of the relevant sectors in the next 5 years. The participants provided a meticulous input toward existing challenges as per the consultation outcome. Feedback presentation: In the conclusion of the consultation workshop meetings in the four states and Banadir region at day 4, the NTP facilitators presented the findings of the consultation to the participants including ministries and director generals of each state. The key representatives attended by federal member state consultation workshops included; - Government Officials Representatives: Participants from various Ministries, Department and Agencies(MDAs). Civil Society Representatives: Advocates for community interests and inclusivity in the planning process. Private Sector Stakeholders: Contributors to discussions on economic transformation and investment needs. Local Council Representatives: Voices from grassroots governance structures to ensure community-level priorities were captured.

With the establishment of Somalia’s federal system, Galmudug became an official federal member state in 2015. However, weak institutions, limited governance capacity, and continued insecurity have constrained the state's ability to deliver essential services and improve the quality of life. Quantitative Online Survey Findings The Federal member state Consultation workshop utilized a two tier’ data collection approach. The first layer involved an online survey, with participation from 572 respondents participated from the government, private sector, civil society, academia and district government representatives. The second tier consisted of group discussions from respective MDAs aimed at understanding the specific challenges, priorities, and potential solutions at the level of MDAs. N A T I O N A L T R A N S F O R M A T I O N P L A N ( N T P ) 2 0 2 5 - 2 0 2 9 FIGURE 131: ONLINE PARTICIPANTS DISTRIBUTION 476 NATIONAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN (NTP) 2025-2029 560 The Figure above provides overview of the distribution of number of respondents participated from the online survey across the four pillars of the national transformation plan consultations. The data reveals distinct levels of engagement for each pillar, highlighting the priorities and interests of participants. The social and human capital transformation pillar had the highest representation, with 35.1% of respondents aligning their focus with issues such as education, healthcare, and social development. This strong participation underscores the importance placed on addressing challenges related to human capital and social equity within the community.
