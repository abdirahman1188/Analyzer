Artificial Intelligence and Somalia's Data Revolution Barriers and Pathways Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a key enabler in addressing developmental challenges in low-income countries, particularly in regions like Somalia, where data gaps and inadequate infrastructure often hinder progress. This study investigates the potential of AI to bridge these gaps in Somalia’s public sector, focusing on its applications in governance, healthcare, and economic planning. Drawing on case studies from sub-Saharan Africa, this paper highlights AI-driven innovations like predictive analytics in public health and digital learning platforms. These examples demonstrate AI’s capacity to improve service delivery, even in resource- constrained environments. However, challenges such as limited digital infrastructure, low human capital, and concerns regarding data privacy remain significant barriers. The paper emphasizes the importance of aligning AI strategies with local needs, fostering public-private partnerships, and investing in capacity-building to ensure successful AI integration. This research aims to provide actionable insights for using AI to drive inclusive and sustainable development in Somalia. Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing sectors across the globe, providing solutions to complex challenges in governance, education, healthcare, and the economy. In Somalia, a country facing multiple socio-economic obstacles, AI presents an opportunity to overcome infrastructural barriers and improve public service delivery. As AI technologies evolve, their adoption in developing countries like Somalia could significantly enhance data-driven decision-making, improve public service accessibility, and support disaster resilience efforts. For instance, AI applications have been successfully utilized in various sub-Saharan African countries for disaster management, healthcare delivery, and agriculture optimization. In Somalia, however, the path to AI adoption is fraught with challenges, including poor data availability, limited digital literacy, and inadequate infrastructure. These issues complicate AI implementation, making it difficult to achieve effective outcomes in critical sectors like healthcare and education. Recent efforts by international organizations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank have attempted to address these challenges, but gaps in AI research specific to Somalia and the public sector remain (World Bank, 2020; UNDP, 2021). This research intends to fill this gap by exploring how AI can be integrated into Somalia’s public sector to enhance service delivery, governance, and economic planning. The paper focuses on three core objectives: (1) examining AI's role in bridging data gaps in key public sectors, (2) identifying challenges to AI implementation in Somalia’s unique context, and (3) proposing strategies for overcoming these challenges. The research will draw on secondary data from international reports and case studies from similar regions, offering a comprehensive understanding of AI’s potential impact and practical challenges in Somalia. Research Gap and Methodology Existing literature on AI in developing countries primarily discusses AI applications in agriculture, healthcare, and infrastructure but rarely explores the integration of AI in the public sector of countries like Somalia, where systemic challenges differ from other regions. This research will fill this gap by focusing specifically on the integration of AI in Somalia’s public sector, examining its impact on service delivery and governance. To gather data, the research will focus on secondary data from reports by organizations such as the World Bank, UNDP, and African Development Bank, which have published insights into AI applications in Africa. Additionally, case studies of AI projects in other low-income countries, particularly in Africa, will be analyzed for relevant parallels to Somalia’s context. These sources will provide empirical evidence and best practices that can be applied to Somalia. While primary data collection might be challenging, insights from international NGOs, policy reports, and academic research will inform the study. The analysis will be guided by qualitative methodologies, employing document analysis to assess the role of AI in solving development challenges in Somalia’s public sector. By synthesizing these secondary sources, the research will provide a detailed framework for AI adoption in Somalia. Conclusion This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the use of AI in Somalia’s public sector, particularly addressing the opportunities and challenges posed by the country’s data limitations and infrastructure issues. The findings will offer valuable insights for policymakers, international development organizations, and researchers looking to leverage AI for development in similar low-income contexts. The study also underscores the importance of capacity building, public-private partnerships, and context-specific AI strategies to ensure that technological innovations translate into tangible benefits for Somalia’s development.
