  "overview": "This research explores the readiness of organizations to adopt AI, focusing on the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework. It investigates factors influencing AI adoption in the front-end planning (FEP) phase of construction projects in Saudi Arabia, aiming to enhance project outcomes and overcome challenges in the construction industry. The research also analyzes existing AI Readiness Assessments and finds that these assessments often miss key information and context about AI implementation in African nations.",
