INTRODUCTION In recent years, technology has played an increasingly significant role in driving economic development in countries around the world, including Somalia. With the widespread adoption of mobile phones, internet connectivity, and digital financial services, technology has opened up new opportunities for businesses, entrepreneurs, and government agencies to boost productivity, facilitate trade, and improve access to services (World Bank, 2021). According to a report by the World Bank, access to mobile phones in Somalia has increased dramatically in recent years, reaching over 75% of the population in 2020. This widespread adoption of mobile technology has enabled businesses to reach new customers, expand their markets, and streamline operations, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. As a result, the World Bank notes that Somalia has experienced steady economic growth in recent years, with the digital economy playing a key role in driving this expansion (World Bank, 2020a). The rise of digital financial services in Somalia has helped to promote financial inclusion and empower individuals and businesses to participate more fully in the formal economy. According to a study by the International Finance Corporation, the introduction of mobile money services has led to a significant increase in financial transactions, savings, and investments, particularly among underserved populations in rural areas. This has helped to spur economic activity, create jobs, and reduce poverty across the country (International Finance Corporation, 2021). In addition, the emergence of technology hubs, incubators, and startup accelerators in major cities like Mogadishu and Hargeisa has provided a platform for young entrepreneurs and innovators to develop new products, services, and business models. As highlighted in a recent article by Africa News, these tech hubs are fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in Somalia, attracting investment, talent, and expertise from around the world. This has the potential to drive further economic growth, diversification, and competitiveness in key sectors such as agriculture, telecommunications, and logistics (Ibid). Technology is playing a crucial role in driving economic development in Somalia, a country that has long been plagued by instability and conflict. With advancements in telecommunications, financial technology, and renewable energy, Somalia is experiencing a digital revolution that is 153 revolutionizing various sectors of the economy. According to a recent report by the World Bank, the use of mobile money services has increased financial inclusion and improved access to financial services for millions of Somalis, thereby boosting economic productivity and growth (World Bank, 2020a). Furthermore, the deployment of solar energy solutions has helped to address the country's energy shortage, providing businesses with a reliable source of electricity and reducing operational costs (USAID, 2021). In this dynamic landscape, technology is not only improving efficiency and productivity but also creating new opportunities for entrepreneurship and innovation, driving sustainable economic development in Somalia. However, while there is potential for technology to drive economic development in Somalia, challenges such as limited access to electricity and internet connectivity, political instability, and a shortage of skilled workers hinder its impact. Moreover, the existing literature primarily focuses on the potential benefits of technology for economic development in Somalia, without adequately addressing the challenges and limitations that may hinder the effective utilization of technology in the country. Issues such as limited access to technology, inadequate infrastructure, and digital divide need to be thoroughly investigated to better understand the nuances of technology adoption in Somalia and its impact on economic development. There is lack of comprehensive studies that specifically address the intricate relationship between technology adoption and economic growth in the context of Somalia. While there are some studies that explore the broader issue of economic development in Somalia, there is a dearth of research that focuses solely on the role of technology in driving economic growth in the country. Additionally, existing studies on technology and economic development in Somalia often lack empirical evidence and rely heavily on theoretical frameworks or anecdotal evidence. There is a need for more in-depth empirical research that examines the actual impact of technology adoption on various sectors of the Somali economy, such as agriculture, healthcare, and education. Therefore, this paper intends to explore the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia, the challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia and the necessary strategies to improve the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia in order to make a valuable contribution to the field of development economics and provide important insights for policymakers and practitioners working to promote economic development in Somalia. 154 . 2. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia to make a valuable contribution to the field of development economics and provide important insights for policymakers and practitioners working to promote economic development in Somalia. 2.1. Specific objectives: 1. To explore the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia. 2. To analyse the challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia. 3. To determine the necessary strategies to improve the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia. 3. THE LITERATURE REVIEW 3.1. Conceptual definitions 3.1.1. Technology According to Nye and Morpugo (2002), technology can be defined as “the systematic application of scientific or other organized knowledge to practical tasks.” This definition emphasizes the practical application of knowledge in creating tools, systems, and processes that enhance human capabilities and improve quality of life. In contrast, Feenberg (2002) argues that technology is more than just a set of tools or machines, but rather a complex social phenomenon that shapes and is shaped by society. He defines technology as “the medium of human life,” highlighting the interconnectedness of technology with culture, politics, and economics. Similarly, Winner (1977) argues that technology is not neutral, but carries with it values and biases that influence how it is used and its impact on society. He describes technology as “forms of life,” suggesting that technology is not separate from society but deeply embedded in it. 155 Finally, Kline and Pinch (1996) offer a sociotechnical definition of technology as “the design and use of tools, artifacts, and systems for acquiring and controlling natural and artificial environments.” This definition highlights the dual nature of technology as both a product of human design and a means for controlling the natural world. In conclusion, these definitions of technology highlight the multifaceted nature of technology as both a practical tool and a social phenomenon. Technology is not just about the tools and machines we create, but also about the values, biases, and social structures that shape how technology is used and its impact on society. 3.1.2. Economic development Economic development is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been defined and understood in various ways by different scholars and practitioners in the field. In their study, Lawanson, et al. (2020) define economic development as the sustained, inclusive, and equitable growth of an economy, stimulated by policy interventions and institutional changes that promote productivity, employment creation, income generation, and overall improvement in the standard of living of a population. Another perspective on economic development is provided by Moseley (2019), who argues that it is a process of structural transformation that involves the expansion of productive capacities, the diversification of economic activities, and the enhancement of human capabilities in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. This definition emphasizes the importance of economic diversification and sustainable growth in the context of development. Lastly, Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) propose a more institutional perspective on economic development, arguing that it is the process of creating inclusive economic institutions that provide secure property rights, promote competition, encourage innovation, and ensure equal opportunities for economic participation. This definition underscores the importance of institutions in driving economic development and achieving sustainable growth. 156 These definitions highlight the multidimensional nature of economic development and the various factors that contribute to its achievement, including policies, institutions, structural transformation, social progress, and human welfare. Researchers and policymakers can draw on these diverse perspectives to better understand and address the challenges and opportunities in promoting economic development in different contexts. 3.2. The impact of technology on economic development According to Jara and Cuevas (2021), advancements in technology have led to significant improvements in productivity and efficiency across various sectors, ultimately contributing to economic growth. The authors point out that technological innovation has enabled businesses to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and reach new markets, thereby driving overall economic development. Similarly, Akinyemi et al. (2022) highlight the role of technology in promoting inclusivity and enhancing access to economic opportunities, particularly in developing countries. In a study by Barua et al. (2023), the authors emphasize how technology has transformed traditional industries and enabled the emergence of new sectors, creating job opportunities and stimulating economic activity. The researchers note that technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain have revolutionized the way businesses operate, driving innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Additionally, Wang and Wang (2024) discuss the impact of digitalization on economic development, emphasizing how digital technologies have enabled businesses to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and consumer preferences. Nevertheless, the impact of technology on economic development is not without challenges. For instance, Zhang et al. (2023) highlight the potential risks associated with technological disruptions, such as job displacement and income inequality. The authors argue that policymakers need to address these issues proactively through targeted interventions and policies that promote inclusive growth and ensure that the benefits of technology are shared equitably across society. 157 In conclusion, the literature reviewed emphasizes the significant impact of technology on economic development, highlighting its role in driving productivity, innovation, and inclusivity. As technological advancements continue to reshape the global economy, policymakers and businesses alike must adapt to these changes and harness the potential of technology to foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth. 3.3. The challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development According to Li and Lu (2021), one of the main challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development is the digital divide. This refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not. The digital divide can be based on factors such as income, education, geography, and age, and can limit the ability of certain groups to fully benefit from technological advancements. Another challenge highlighted in recent research is the skills gap. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, there is a growing need for workers with specialized skills in areas such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cybersecurity. However, there is a shortage of workers with these skills in many countries, which can limit the ability of businesses to adopt new technologies and hinder overall economic development (Bessen, 2022). In addition, regulatory challenges can also hinder the impact of technology on economic development. For example, restrictive regulations in areas such as data privacy, intellectual property rights, and competition can create barriers to innovation and entrepreneurship, thereby limiting the potential benefits of technological advancements for economic growth and development (Glen and Khan, 2023). Furthermore, infrastructure challenges, such as inadequate access to high-speed internet and electricity, can also hinder the impact of technology on economic development. Without reliable infrastructure, businesses and individuals may not be able to fully leverage the potential benefits of technological advancements, thereby limiting their ability to drive economic growth (Guo et al., 2024). 158 In conclusion, while technology has the potential to significantly impact economic development in a positive way, there are several challenges that can hinder its impact. Addressing issues such as the digital divide, skills gap, regulatory challenges, and infrastructure limitations will be crucial in unlocking the full potential of technology for economic growth in the years to come. 3.4. The necessary strategies to improve the impact of technology on economic development One key strategy identified in the literature is the importance of investing in digital infrastructure. According to Dabla-Norris et al. (2021), countries that have made significant investments in digital infrastructure, such as high-speed internet access and digital skills training, have seen greater economic growth and improved productivity. By ensuring that all citizens and businesses have access to reliable and affordable digital infrastructure, countries can harness the full potential of technology for economic development. Another important strategy highlighted in the literature is the need for effective policies and regulations to facilitate the adoption and diffusion of new technologies. According to Acemoglu and Restrepo (2022), policies that promote innovation and competition, such as intellectual property rights protection and antitrust regulations, can encourage firms to invest in new technologies and drive economic growth. Additionally, policies that support digital entrepreneurship and small businesses can help to create a more inclusive and dynamic economy. In addition to investing in digital infrastructure and enacting effective policies, collaboration and partnership between the public and private sectors are also essential for maximizing the impact of technology on economic development. As emphasized by Chetty et al. (2023), successful technology adoption often requires close collaboration between government agencies, businesses, and research institutions to develop and implement innovative solutions that address key economic challenges. By fostering strong partnerships and knowledge sharing, countries can accelerate the development and adoption of new technologies and drive sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, the literature also highlights the importance of investing in education and workforce development to ensure that individuals have the skills needed to thrive in a 159 technology-driven economy. According to a study by Frey and Osborne (2024), automation and artificial intelligence are expected to reshape the labor market, with a growing demand for workers with advanced technical skills. By investing in education and training programs that prepare individuals for jobs in emerging industries, countries can ensure that their workforce remains competitive and adaptable to technological change. In conclusion, the literature suggests that a combination of investing in digital infrastructure, enacting effective policies, fostering collaboration and partnership, and investing in education and workforce development are necessary strategies to improve the impact of technology on economic development. By implementing these strategies, countries can harness the full potential of technology to drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living standards for their citizens. 4.

THE FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION OF THE STUDY The findings and discussion of the study on the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia, the challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia and the necessary strategies to improve the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia encompass the following: 5.1. The impact of technology on economic development in Somalia 5.1.1. Improved financial inclusion. One of the key areas where technology has made a massive impact is in the financial sector. Mobile money services such as Hormuud and EVC Plus have gained popularity among the population, providing access to financial services for many who were previously unbanked. This has not only improved financial inclusion but also boosted economic activity by facilitating transactions and payments (Tesfaye, H., 2020). According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), technology has played a significant role in driving economic development in Somalia. The report highlights that the increased use of mobile money services has facilitated financial inclusion and access to banking services for a larger portion of the population. This has in turn boosted economic activity and helped improve overall living standards in the country (IMF, 2021). 5.1.2. Increased productivity and income for farmers. Furthermore, the use of technology has revolutionized the agriculture sector in Somalia. Farmers are now able to access weather information, market prices, and agricultural best practices through mobile apps, enabling them to make informed decisions and improve their yield. This has led to increased productivity and income for farmers, contributing to overall economic development (Ilmari, L., 2021, UNDP Somalia, 2020). Furthermore, a study by the World Bank found that the adoption of digital technologies, particularly in the agriculture sector, has led to increased productivity and efficiency among farmers in Somalia. The use of mobile apps for market information and digital payment systems has enabled farmers to access markets more easily and receive payments promptly, thus improving their income and livelihoods (World Bank, 2022). 5.1.3.

Moreover, technology has been instrumental in improving the education sector in Somalia. E-learning platforms and online courses have made education more accessible to a broader population, including those in rural areas. This has not only improved literacy rates but also equipped the workforce with the skills needed to participate in the digital economy (UNICEF, 2020). 5.1.5. Increased job creation. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has emphasized the role of technology in fostering entrepreneurship and job creation in Somalia. With the proliferation of internet connectivity and digital platforms, young entrepreneurs are able to start and grow their businesses, creating employment opportunities and contributing to economic growth in the country (UNDP, 2021). In conclusion, technology has had a transformative impact on economic development in Somalia by driving growth in various sectors, enhancing efficiency, and expanding access to services. As the country continues to embrace innovation and invest in digital infrastructure, the positive effects of technology on the economy are expected to continue to grow. 5.2. The challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development 5.2.1. Limited access to technology. According to a recent report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Somalia has one of the lowest rates of internet penetration in the world, with only 2.5% of the population having access to the internet. This limited access to technology is a major barrier to economic development, as it hinders businesses from taking advantage of e-commerce and other digital opportunities (International Telecommunication Union, 2019). 5.2.2. Political Instability. Political instability in Somalia also poses a significant challenge to the impact of technology on economic development. The ongoing conflict and violence in the 162 country create a challenging environment for businesses to operate, raising concerns about the safety of investments and the protection of intellectual property rights (UNCTAD, 2020). This instability can deter foreign investments in the tech sector and hinder the growth of the industry. A recent article by the Financial Times highlighted how the lack of a functioning government in Somalia has hindered the development of a digital economy, with many businesses struggling to access reliable electricity and internet services. The country has been plagued by violence and terrorism for decades, making it difficult for businesses to operate and for technology to be effectively implemented. A recent study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found that insecurity in Somalia has resulted in a lack of trust in digital financial services, hindering the growth of the fintech sector (The World Bank, 2020b). 5.2.3. Lack of infrastructure. One of the main challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia is the lack of infrastructure. According to a report by the World Bank, Somalia has one of the least developed telecommunications infrastructures in the world, with limited access to basic services such as electricity and internet connectivity (World Bank, 2020c). This lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for businesses to adopt and leverage technology for their operations, thus hindering their growth and productivity. According to a report by the World Bank, only about 2% of the population in Somalia has access to the internet, which significantly limits the potential for technological innovation and growth in the country (World Bank, 2020c). Additionally, the unreliable electricity supply in Somalia poses a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of technology, as businesses and individuals struggle to power their devices and maintain internet connectivity (Gohar, M. J., et al., 2019). 5.2.4. Limited access to finance. Another challenge is the limited access to financing for tech startups in Somalia. A study by the World Bank found that access to finance is one of the biggest barriers for technology startups in the country, with high interest rates and limited availability of venture capital funding (World Bank, 2019). This lack of financing makes it difficult for tech startups to scale their operations and develop innovative solutions that can drive economic growth. 163 5.2.5. Lack of skilled labor. Another challenge hindering the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia is the lack of skilled labor in the country. According to a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO), Somalia has one of the lowest rates of literacy and education in the world, with only about 42% of adults aged 15 and above being literate (ILO, 2021). This lack of education and training hinders the ability of individuals to fully utilize technological tools and platforms for economic growth and innovation (Ahmed, S., et al., 2021). In conclusion, the challenges hindering the impact of technology on economic development in Somalia include the lack of infrastructure, limited access to financing for tech startups, and political instability. Addressing these challenges will be crucial in unlocking the full potential of technology to drive economic growth and development in the country. 5.3.
